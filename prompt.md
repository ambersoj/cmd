Thanks for the code.  It works great and it's very exciting.  I'm fairly new to design patterns but I"m a big fan.  If one were to compare the description of the Observer pattern in the famous GoF book "Design Patterns" would the Subject be an abstract receive buffer and a DCE be an abstract Observer?

In the DCE class is the run() method where the rest of the system can access the DCE class?  Right now the run() method just prints out a hearbeat every second but is the intention for actual real-world implementation that this run() method be the sort of take-off point for another part of a program to run its logic in it?  Like if this DCE class had libnet and pcap initialization of the tap in the initializeTAP() method along with the fap creation then maybe that run() routine could act like one of the players in the Observer pattern, like maybe a ConcreteObserver?  But don't let me convice or influence you... I don't know, I'm asking

Now what I'd like us to do is get an Observer pattern working so that we have 3 rx buffers that will store what's captured by pcap at a tap and that's all.  Just put the payload in the buffer, no ethernet protocol at all, no time stamp, no nothing, but the payload, preferable in a nice humanly readable form.

That'll be the rx channel for the cmd, that I alone or the both of us together will integrate into the cmd code base.

Don't generate code just yet, partner.  For now I'd like us to talk and answer questions until we're in agreement and up to speed.

///////

Questions Before We Code
How do you want to map TAPs to RX buffers? Should each TAP have exactly one RX buffer, or do multiple DCEs share the same buffer?
Do you want the RX buffers to hold multiple packets, or just the latest payload? (FIFO vs. last-packet-wins)
Should we introduce an event-driven mechanism for notifying Observers? (Or just have the Observers manually check for new data?)

/////////

Ok, I'm glad we're talking, because I'm pretty sure I got the Observer pattern backwards in my application.  I think I want DCEs to be on the subject side of things and receive buffers to be on the observation side of Observer operations.  The DCE tap will be identical to a physical ethernet card so once it's initialized with libnet and pcap (on the DCE side we'll be more interested in the packet capture, rx, DCE, pcap stuff) we will be able to just operate pcap as though it was the ConcreteSubject (the DCE holding state) and the rx buffer being the ConcreteObserver, the one handling the data.

# Answers to questions #

The DCEs will each have an rx buffer and they'll work fifo.  And they'll have only payload in them, as we discussed and there absolutely no concern given to buffer overflow.  When rx <dce> is run it take out the oldest log and the the fifo is shortened appropriately.  If the rx <dce> is run on an empty queue there are no ramifications and a NULL is returned for payload.  For now at least the Observers will check for new data without an event driven mechanism.

I'm glad we're having this talk.  I'm eager to hear your comments and questions, partner!

/////////////

Questions Before We Code
Do you want fixed-size RX Buffers, or should they dynamically grow as needed?
How do you want to handle RX Buffers persisting across runs (if at all)? Should they be cleared on restart?
Should the RX buffer be thread-safe in case you later want to access it from multiple threads?

////////////////

# Answers to questions #
I want fixed size bufers.  They'll probably only have to hold a couple messages before they're consumed.  This whole sytem is all human controlled in this first carnation where it's just these first 4 components, all based on this cmd we got going here.  As far a what's typical for a system such as this by way of a fixed buffer I'll defer to your inclination for the size.  There might be a circumstance where there's some computer generated DTE/DCE traffic so try to find a good comprimise at the very low side of a fixed size buffer for a slow type of computer comms system.  But yeah, just fixed size.

I think the rx buffers should be cleard on startup.  No persistent state.  However, I wouldn't explicitly clear the buffer so if in between sessions you so happen to get the same pointer to the buffer, the old messages might still be there, but you'd never know unless you had a way to look and actually wanted to.

I like the idea of each DCE running in a thread for sure but over and above whatever thread safety is needed as a minmum for that I wouldn't add.

///////////////

Next Steps Before Code
Do you like a buffer size of 8, or do you want it smaller/larger?
Do you prefer dropping the oldest message when full, or should we reject new messages if full?
Would you like a command to check buffer size & current occupancy (e.g., rx_status <dce>)?

////////////////

# Answers to questions #
- that buffer size of 8 is fine.
- yes I'd like to drop the oldest message.
- if you'd like to rig up a command for buffer status that would be great.  I'll show you the Command class code below:

class Command {
public:
    using CommandFunction = std::function<void()>;

    Command(std::string name, CommandFunction func);

    void execute() const;

    const std::string getName() const;

private:
    std::string name;
    CommandFunction func;
};

Commands are constructed with a name and a function pointer so if you'd make your command like a Command class object that would be grateful and it would be appreciated for when it's time to be integrated in with the existing Command pattern in the cmd code base.

It was nice how you got all the code in one file last time - that was good thinking.  And with a main() was nice and we can separate out the declarations and implementations later when it time to migrate the DCE and Observer code you're working on and have already wrote some of over to the existing cmd code base, right?  So for now let's get this receive side of things with the DCEs and the Observers and rx buffers running in your single file with the main() wiring it all together and perturbing it with, right?  Correct me if I'm wrong, otherwise send the code down, partner!

//////////////

Please take a look at this EthernetFrame code, which you'll maybe use yourself one day, and see if you can find what's wrong and fix it.  VSCode complains about the constructor.  It's missing two method() implementations as well.  The thing is that it compiles from the command line with this:

g++ -o demo demo.cpp -Iusr/include/jsoncpp/json -lnet -lpcap -ljsoncpp

It gives very nice output:

root@PRED:/usr/local/cmd# ./demo
Buffer1 Size: 1
Buffer2 Size: 1
Consumed: Packet from DCE1
Buffer1 Size: 2
Buffer2 Size: 3
Consumed: Packet from DCE1

Buffer2 Size: 5
Consumed: Packet from DCE1
Buffer1 Size: 4

Consumed: Packet from DCE1
Buffer1 Size: 5
Buffer2 Size: 8
Consumed: Packet from DCE1
exit
root@PRED:/usr/local/cmd# exit
logout
user1@PRED:~$ 

I'm grateful for that code, thanks!  Until I get that EthernetFrame class behaving I won't be able to run the VSCode debugger, which is a shame because I find it fun.

About DCE initialization.  I don't see any mention of libnet or pcap implementation in the code you've generated and I wonder if it's strategically being left until later, or if it's an oversight and also I'd like to inform you that I added a system call to the DCE destructor in the version before this last one:

    ~DCE() {
        stop();
        system("ip link delete tap0");
    }

Is that a good enough way for us to release the taps?

How would you recommend moving forward now?  When the code that you're working on now is intializing the DCE taps so that they're ready to go with libnet and pcap and the observers and rx buffers are all in place I'll integrate this code into the cmd codebase and you and I can then work on a DTE driver.  And don't forget that all DTEs and DCEs need to be operated with both pcap and libnet because just because a DTE primarily transmits with libnet it might use the rx channel and pcap for handshaking and the same goes for DCEs.

Here's the EthernetFrame code:

// EthernetFrame.hpp

    EthernetFrame(const std::array<uint8_t, 6>& srcMac, const std::array<uint8_t, 6>& dstMac, const std::vector<uint8_t>& payload);

    srcMac = mac;
}

    dstMac = mac;
}

void EthernetFrame::setPayload(const std::vector<uint8_t>& data) {
    payload = data;
}

const std::array<uint8_t, 6>& EthernetFrame::getSrcMac() const {
    return srcMac;
}

const std::array<uint8_t, 6>& EthernetFrame::getDstMac() const {
    return dstMac;
}

std::vector<uint8_t>& EthernetFrame::getPayload() {
    return payload;
}

std::vector<uint8_t> EthernetFrame::serialize() const {
    std::vector<uint8_t> data;
    data.insert(data.end(), srcMac.begin(), srcMac.end());
    data.insert(data.end(), dstMac.begin(), dstMac.end());
    data.insert(data.end(), payload.begin(), payload.end());
    return data;
}

EthernetFrame EthernetFrame::deserialize(const std::vector<uint8_t>& data) {
    if (data.size() < 12) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Invalid Ethernet frame size");
    }
    
    EthernetFrame frame;
    std::copy(data.begin(), data.begin() + 6, frame.srcMac.begin());
    std::copy(data.begin() + 6, data.begin() + 12, frame.dstMac.begin());
    frame.getPayload().assign(data.begin() + 12, data.end());
    
    return frame;
}

I might have the json.h and the compiler -I, -l or -L wrong... maybe I need a -L.  At the path /usr/include/jsoncpp/json there's a json.h though.

# Your First Three Next Steps
1. Test EthernetFrame in VSCode Debugger.
2. Integrate TAP initialization into DCE.
3. Ensure both DTE & DCE use pcap & libnet for RX/TX.

But that VSCode dubugger stuff isn't the primary focus for us.  I got your EthernetFrame code in the project and I"m happy to say it looks very good and it's in the project folder with no errors and the cmd CMake load build runs just fine.  So, with that in mind feel free to completely ignore the VSCode compile and debugger issue in favor of the cmd code.  So this go-around in messages focus on 2. and 3. above, but 1. would be nice to have too.

/////////////////////

Ok that looks really great with all the libnet and pcap usage.  Now I'd like you to look at the code below, which is the previous version of the code you've been sending me (which I call demo.cpp) where the Observer is in place.  Now right at the end of your last message you put down as a next step "2. Create a simple observer model for notifying packet reception" but it seems to me the below code, you previous code, has the Observer pattern implemented for this purpose already.  I'd like for you to make a final demo.cpp with all of the functionality of the Observer pattern, with all of the libnet and pcap stuff of this current iteration and also the tap creation and initialization.

///////////////////

Alright, thanks for the VSCode help.  I'm lookin at demo.cpp with the debugger now, and it's likely to help us quite a bit.

Right off the bat the program crashes in the DCE constructor because it tries to initialize a tap before creating the tap.  The taps need to be created and it's these virtualized ethernet NICs is what I expect your code to initialize and use with pcap and libnet as though they were real, physical NICs.  The code you're adding to and continuing to enhance in demo.cpp with functionality will have to create the taps (two in our sample demo), set them up and operate them for their lifetimes with libnet and pcap, and gracefully release and destroy everything that needs to be.  While up and operating the code you're adding to and enhancing in demo.cpp has to use the Observer pattern that you've implemented in the code already to service the rx buffers.

This iteration it crashed on:

        pcapHandle = pcap_open_live(tapName.c_str(), BUFSIZ, 1, 1000, errbuf);

likely because there was no tap created for it to be applied to as dev.  What you should use for dev is the name you gave the tap when you created it.

/////////////////

It works really well.  But it gets lost in the pcap_loop though. So the program never terminates, it goes into start capture and stays there.  The taps are getting created and capture real traffic as confirmed by wireshark.  Do those pcap_loops need to be put in their own threads or something?


//////////////////


Oh it's a thing of beauty now.  It's very exciting.  I've got a Command pattern in the cmd code base that I'm aching to point at the DTE part of cmd the way you and I just pointed the DCE part of the code at the rx buffers.

I've got a question.  Is this part of the code in Observer:

class RxObserver : public IObserver {
public:
    void update(const std::vector<uint8_t>& packet) override {
        // Process received packet
        std::cout << "RxObserver received packet of size: " << packet.size() << " bytes" << std::endl;
    }
};

where in practice the rx buffer could be written with packet, or a part of packet, like packet.size() instead of just being printed out with std::cout, like in the code and the example above?  Would it be the proper use of to write the packets to their respective rx buffers, instead of just printing out a message?

And I was wondering if in that code there are two taps and they each have an observer and they could both be connected to individual rx buffers.

/////////////////////

# Chat GPT Partner Feedback and Way Forward #

Good morning, partner.  Here's somefeedback for you.  You have done a very very good job for me and I'm grateful.  Your code, with the odd tweak here and there by me, has resulted in a really nice DCE RX channel for cmd.  I managed to scrounge up some kbhit() code, because the conio.h one was being difficult.  I currently have this in main() of our demo.cpp:

bool kbhit()
{
    termios term;
    tcgetattr(0, &term);

    termios term2 = term;
    term2.c_lflag &= ~ICANON;
    tcsetattr(0, TCSANOW, &term2);

    int byteswaiting;
    ioctl(0, FIONREAD, &byteswaiting);

    tcsetattr(0, TCSANOW, &term);

    return byteswaiting > 0;
}

int main() {
    try {
        std::string tap1 = createTapDevice("tap0");
        std::string tap2 = createTapDevice("tap1");

        // Initialize libnet
        char errbuf[LIBNET_ERRBUF_SIZE];
        libnet_t *lnet1 = libnet_init(LIBNET_RAW4, tap1.c_str(), errbuf);
        libnet_t *lnet2 = libnet_init(LIBNET_RAW4, tap2.c_str(), errbuf);
        if (!lnet1 || !lnet2) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Failed to initialize libnet: " + std::string(errbuf));
        }

        // Create DCE instances for each TAP device
        auto dce1 = std::make_shared<DCE>(tap1);
        auto dce2 = std::make_shared<DCE>(tap2);

        // Create Observers for each DCE instance
        auto observer1 = std::make_shared<RxObserver>();
        auto observer2 = std::make_shared<RxObserver>();

        // Attach Observers
        dce1->attach(observer1);
        dce2->attach(observer2);

        std::vector<uint8_t> packet1 = observer1->getNextPacket();

        std::cout << "DCE is running. Press Enter to exit..." << std::endl;

        // Start packet capture
        dce1->startCapture();
        dce2->startCapture();

        bool running = true;
        int i = 100;
        while(!kbhit())
        {
            sleep(.1);
            std::vector<uint8_t> packet1 = observer1->getNextPacket();

            if (!packet1.empty()) {
                std::cout << "Processing packet from TAP 1, size: " << packet1.size() << " bytes" << std::endl;
            }

            std::vector<uint8_t> packet2 = observer2->getNextPacket();
            if (!packet2.empty()) {
                std::cout << "Processing packet from TAP 2, size: " << packet2.size() << " bytes" << std::endl;
            }

        }

        // Stop packet capture
        dce1->stopCapture();
        dce2->stopCapture();

        // Cleanup libnet
        libnet_destroy(lnet1);
        libnet_destroy(lnet2);

    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

The kbhit() and while(!kbhit()) stuff is just temporary.  For now if gives demo.cpp a nice way to quit out while monitoring for observer action... I'll say it works well.  Here's some random screen output to give you an idea of its performance:

root@PRED:/usr/local/cmd# ./demo

I have a question now.  DCEs aren't just silent rx devices, they have an upstream capability, even though formally its focus should be to facilitate the DTEs transfer.  For my application of taps as DCEs I'm not presently using the up stream capability of the tap DCEs.  We should have a command tx <dce-src-mac> <dte-dst-mac> <payload> to be a proper DCE.  But this brings up the question of demo.cpp/cmd project integration because when we talk about adding commands we're talking about using the Command pattern code that's already present in cmd (I've sent you that code, you might still have it and are able to look at it, otherwise if you ask I'll happily send it to you).

I want to run this idea past you that what we take on next is creating a command in demo.cpp kind of along the lines of the main() in cmd:

void testCommandFunction() {
    std::cout << "Test command executed successfully!" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    Cmd myCmd;
    myCmd.addCommand("Test command", testCommandFunction);

    std::cout << "Executing stored command..." << std::endl;
    myCmd.executeCommand("Test command");

    return 0;
}

See above where a command is created and then executed just as a test in my production/dev environment.  Could you take the existing cmd code of Cmd, Command and EthernetFrame, along with your demo.cpp code and put them together with a new main() to create an integrated single program with both the command handling capability of cmd and also the rx dce capabilities of demo.cpp?  Maybe it would look something like this:

// demo.cpp

#include <Cmd.hpp>
#include <Command.hpp>

int main()
{

    // This pseudo-code makes the commands
    Cmd myCmd;
    myCmd.addCommand("tx_dce", tx_dceFunction);
    myCmd.addCommand("rx_dce", rx_dceFunction);

    // This pseudo-code makes the taps and initializes the taps and operates 
    // the taps with libnet and pcap
try {
        std::string tap1 = createTapDevice("tap0");
        std::string tap2 = createTapDevice("tap1");

        // Initialize libnet
        char errbuf[LIBNET_ERRBUF_SIZE];
        libnet_t *lnet1 = libnet_init(LIBNET_RAW4, tap1.c_str(), errbuf);
        libnet_t *lnet2 = libnet_init(LIBNET_RAW4, tap2.c_str(), errbuf);
        if (!lnet1 || !lnet2) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Failed to initialize libnet: " + std::string(errbuf));
        }

        // Create DCE instances for each TAP device
        auto dce1 = std::make_shared<DCE>(tap1);
        auto dce2 = std::make_shared<DCE>(tap2);

        // Create Observers for each DCE instance
        auto observer1 = std::make_shared<RxObserver>();
        auto observer2 = std::make_shared<RxObserver>();

        // Attach Observers
        dce1->attach(observer1);
        dce2->attach(observer2);

        std::vector<uint8_t> packet1 = observer1->getNextPacket();

        // Start packet capture
        dce1->startCapture();
        dce2->startCapture();

        // This pseudo-code transmits on the DCEs and also explicitly receives on a DCE.
        // Remember if the rx buffer is empty there are no consequences, just an empty payload.
        myCmd.executeCommand("tx_dce_tap1");
        myCmd.executeCommand("tx_dce_tap2");
        myCmd.executeCommand("rx_dce_tap1");
        myCmd.executeCommand("rx_dce_tap2");

        // Stop packet capture
        dce1->stopCapture();
        dce2->stopCapture();

        // Cleanup libnet
        libnet_destroy(lnet1);
        libnet_destroy(lnet2);

    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

Don't code anything yet... let's get our plan of action highly detailed and get your questions answered first and anwwering your question always makes my understanding of what I'm trying to accomplish clearer too.

So let's start off with you commenting and criticizing what's above, with respect to the integration of demo.cpp and cmd and the cmd classes of Cmd, Command and EthernetFrame.

//////////////////////

There are just a couple things to fix that I've spotted right away and VSCode flags as erroneous:

            EthernetFrame frame(data);
            dce1->transmitFrame(frame);

The constructor for a frame is like this:

EthernetFrame::EthernetFrame(const std::array<uint8_t, 6>& srcMac, 
                             const std::array<uint8_t, 6>& dstMac, 
                             const std::vector<uint8_t>& payload) 
    : srcMac(srcMac), dstMac(dstMac), payload(payload) {}

so the EthernetFrame frame(data) line doesn't work.

And not only is EthernetFrame frame wrong but there is no DCE::transmitFrame() method.  Can you please properly create the EthernetFrame and add a DCE::transmitFrame() method?


////////////////////

Please advise on how to use the command dce_transmit on the demo.cpp command line.

Also, could you send me the updated DCE.h with the transmitFrame() method in it please?

Something is still wrong and I might have an idea what.  See this:

void Command::execute() const {
        func();
}

and notice that func() doesn't have any arguments.  Will we need and overloaded func() method?  For testing purposed and simplicity I'd like something quick for now that'll make the new dce_transmit command work.  For now I don't want you to provide a comprehensive solution that'll work in the generic case, just something quick and easy to prove the concept of dce transmission.

Here's the compiler output:

I hope you can help me getting the dce_transmit function to get through the sorting process and actually execute the command.  You see the system will perform addCommand("name", func_ptr) but at the time it runs with the arguments it compares the whole line to the "name" like this:

"dce_transmit 11:22:33:44:55:66 aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff \"Hello world!!\""

So I get command not found, of course.

///////////////

Take a closer look at how the user inputs the dce_transmit command and whether quotes are used for arguments or not and how spaces are considered.  With regards to the spaces "Hello World!!" internally to the program splits up the input string, even the payload it seems, at ' ' characters, the space. 

Created TAP device: tap0
Created TAP device: tap1
DCE is running.
Enter command: 
dce_transmit 11:22:33:44:55:66 aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff "Hello World!!"

payload[0] = '"'
payload[1] = 'H'
payload[2] = 'e'
payload[3] = 'l'
payload[4] = 'l'
payload[5] = 'o'

srcMac:
    _M_elems[0] = 17
    _M_elems[1] = 34
    _M_elems[2] = 51
    _M_elems[3] = 68
    _M_elems[4] = 85
    _M_elems[5] = 102

- Hey partner I just realized that those elems are multiples of 17, probably unimportant though.

dstMac:
    _M_elems[0] = 170
    _M_elems[1] = 187
    _M_elems[2] = 204
    _M_elems[3] = 221
    _M_elems[4] = 238
    _M_elems[5] = 255

- strange relationship to 17 here too, but probably unimportant unless it's significant to you.

In this DCE code:

    void transmitFrame(const EthernetFrame& frame) {
        libnet_ptag_t ethernetTag = libnet_build_ethernet(
            frame.getDstMac().data(), frame.getSrcMac().data(),
            ETHERTYPE_IP, frame.getPayload().data(), frame.getPayload().size(),
            lnet, 0
        );

        if (ethernetTag == -1) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Failed to build Ethernet frame: " + std::string(libnet_geterror(lnet)));
        }

the ethernetTag is always returned as -1 and this is where I need your help.  Could this usage of libnet ge getting the wrong data?  Could this usage of libnet be conflicting with its initialization - like the diffence between the layer 2 initialization vs layer 3?

////////////////////////
I've changed the initialization to LIBNET_LINK.  Thanks for the advice.

I'm working with the new parseCommand() function you've sent and it has some behaior we'll have to iron out.

First of all the input is:

R"(dce_transmit 11:22:33:44:55:66 aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff "Hello World!!")"

in the main() of that parseCommand() file that I call input.cpp.  But on the terminal prompt how am I expected to use quotes and '(' and ')' to work with demo.cpp and the dce_transmit command when I'm running it in person?

When I step through the parseCommand() code what is does is take what it calls a token and assigns it dce_transmit which in turn is assigned to args then it fails on the while loop condition and falls out of parseCommand() with args bein just args[0] = "dce_transmit".

std::vector<std::string> parseCommand(const std::string& input) {
    std::vector<std::string> args;
    std::istringstream iss(input);
    std::string token;
    bool inQuotes = false;
    std::string quotedString;

    while (iss >> std::noskipws >> token) {
        if (token.front() == '"' && !inQuotes) {
            inQuotes = true;
            quotedString = token.substr(1); // Remove leading quote
        } else if (token.back() == '"' && inQuotes) {
            inQuotes = false;
            quotedString += " " + token.substr(0, token.length() - 1); // Remove trailing quote
            args.push_back(quotedString);
        } else if (inQuotes) {
            quotedString += " " + token;
        } else {
            args.push_back(token);
        }
    }
    
    return args;
}

this is the branch it executes to put "dce_transmit" in args[0].
-             args.push_back(token);

Then it fails this condition:
-     while (iss >> std::noskipws >> token) {

and args returns with just the command name:

args = args[0] = "dce_transmit"


///////////////////////
This is interesting.  It's still not working.  Output of ./input is:

args[0] = dce_transmit

It picks up the dce_transmit part properly.

The while loop condition fails next iteration and it's this:

    while (iss >> std::noskipws >> token) {

but in the debugger variable window it says this about iss:

iss = Cannot instantiate printer for default visualizer

I don't know how the while loop would evaluate the condition statement with iss displayed in the debugger so strangely.  Could maybe the parameter "input" be handled improperly somewhere in the area of treating input as a value or a pointer?

////////////////////

This is going really well.  Thanks for your help.  I'd like you to help me use parseCommand() in demo.  Where my command selection and ultimate calling of the function was being done is in Cmd.cpp:

void Cmd::executeCommand(const std::string& name) const {
    std::istringstream iss(name);
    std::string commandName;
    iss >> commandName;  // Extract the first word

    auto it = commands.find(commandName);
    if (it != commands.end()) {
        std::vector<std::string> args;
        std::string arg;
        while (iss >> arg) {
            args.push_back(arg);
        }
        it->second.execute(args);
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Command not found: " << commandName << std::endl;
    }
}

This line:

        it->second.execute(args);

takes the args which is what parseCommand() returns, but I don't have a really good way of getting the parseCommand() output into the it->secong.execute(args); statement.  Should I make parseCommand a member method?  Or should is it more appropriate for it to be a helper function?

Please advise on this?

I'm happy to say that I have all the code integrated together so that the cmd, the core component that all of the mpp components will base off of, can accept the command dce_transmit and receive packets that are written to rx buffers.  It now looks like this:

It's output is as follows:

DCE is running.
Enter command:

Enter command:

The traffic is confirmed with wireshark.

The RxObserver::getNextPacket() does a good job of filling RxBuffer.

So where we're at with cmd is a very nice little system.  I wonder if you recall the beginning of our session and the discussion of how the cmd components will behave and things like broadcasting the commands that are entered in json unless the command is >quiet in which case the command broadcasting behavior is suppressed.  Recall that the cmd with almost the exact functionality as it has now will the generic base component form which all components will start and then all the components will grow to specialize in something.  There are 24 taps in the complete system according to this table:

Cmd has two DCE channels so with just one more DCE channel it will be complete as far as DCE rx and tx goes, I think.  Pretty close to finished, if it's not.

Now Cmd needs three DTE channels.  All of the DCE and DTE channels need to be named as shown in the above table.  For now instead of rigging up a way to dynamically assignin mac addresses let's just put them in #DEFINE lines for now.

I don't want you to generate any code now, partner, but I'd like to hear what your thoughts are and hear your comments and take your questions.  We're doing great and I'm graeful for you help and value you a great deal, partner!  Let's keep up the high achievement!

///////////////////

Oh I'm so glad I chat with you in these little post-implementation and post-integration lulls because I've decided to ditch the whole boot-stap thing and just make the cmd 6 channels all equivalent and bidirectional with only the designations in their names distinguishing their intended purpose.  The cmd will have some commands in place out of the box to operate each of the channels and because each DCE currently has bidirectional capability the differnece between a DCE and a DTE is in name alone, isn't it?  And if that's so then the DCE should be named differently because now all of the ports will be the same and the distinction between DTE and DCE will be implied by the tap names as layed out in the tap-to-mac table above.  We'll a command to transmit a frame from any of the 6 COM (the DCE will become the COM) blocks to any of the other ports and we'll have a command to do a message retreive process of any of the COM blocks.  It'll be total freedom and modular and bidirectional and it'll all be tamed by something of an OS providing services so the code we've done pretty much is a BIOS with this model.

So correct me if I'm wrong but we're pretty much just adding 4 COM blocks away from pretty much having a cmd block that'll make for a perfectly good generic component starting point for mpp.


I'd like to hear your thoughts and answer your questions and read you comments!

///////////////////////////

Judging from you response you see this cmd pretty much like I do now... 6 COMS blocks with a couple commands out of the box to do a basic <srcMac> to <dstMac> transmission of a completely arbitrary manner and a basic read of a <dstMac> RxBuffer and retrieve a single message (or empty if no messages) of a completely arbitrary manner.  And then a command to quit and that's it I think, right?

I'd like to express my willingness to keep the DCE called DCE for now.  I think that we should be happy with getting the six channels altogether and even though to you and I they are COM blocks we'll just keep calling them DCEs because I'm afraid of messing up in VSCode and having an avoidable delay right in on the home stretch here and I'm not willing to jeopardize the possibility of having a cmd before I go to bed tonight.  Do you feel ok with still calling the COM DCE for a while yet?

If you'd like to take a crack at wiring together all of those classes that we made in 6 symmetrical channels and feel confident you can follow the tap-to-mac table then I'd like you to try it.  But I'm only saying this because I've been so impressed by your great capability - I'd have to thing about it and plan some more if I were to do it myself but I thought maybe it would all be very clear exactly what to do already, in which case feel free to.  But if you have more questions or concerns I'll enjoy very much taking them and discussing them.  I enjoy our talks a great deal, partner!

////////////////////////

Tell me if my understanding of what to do with the Cmd.hpp file called Cmd Dce Channels is correct, ok?

If I take the methods in that file you sent and put the signatures in the Cmd.hpp part of the Cmd class and the implementation parts of the methods in the .cpp part of the Cmd class, then I can make a main() that creates a Cmd and kicks it off like this:

#include "Cmd.hpp"

int main()
{
    Cmd cmd;
    cmd.run();
    exit(0);
}

Is that true?

I like the naming just tap0 to 5 and once again the new OS I'm going to make for this system will abstract them into dte and dce.

//////////////

Is this code going to give the trouble that we created the helper function parseCommand() to handle?

void Cmd::run() {
    std::string command;
    while (true) {
        std::cout << "cmd> ";
        std::getline(std::cin, command);
        
        if (command == "exit") break;
        
        auto tokens = tokenize(command);
        if (tokens.size() >= 3 && tokens[0] == "send") {
            send(tokens[1], tokens[2], tokens[3]);
        } else if (tokens.size() == 2 && tokens[0] == "recv") {
            std::cout << recv(tokens[1]) << "\n";
        } else {
            std::cout << "Unknown command.\n";
        }
    }
}

std::vector<std::string> Cmd::tokenize(const std::string& str) {
    std::vector<std::string> tokens;
    std::istringstream iss(str);
    std::string token;
    while (iss >> token) tokens.push_back(token);
    return tokens;
}

This is the parseCommand() that we made:

std::vector<std::string> parseCommand(const std::string& input) {
    std::vector<std::string> args;
    std::istringstream iss(input);
    std::string token;
    bool inQuotes = false;
    std::string quotedString;

    while (std::getline(iss, token, ' ')) {  // Read tokens by space
        if (!token.empty()) {
            if (token.front() == '"' && !inQuotes) {
                inQuotes = true;
                quotedString = token.substr(1);  // Remove leading quote
            } else if (token.back() == '"' && inQuotes) {
                inQuotes = false;
                quotedString += " " + token.substr(0, token.length() - 1);  // Remove trailing quote
                args.push_back(quotedString);
            } else if (inQuotes) {
                quotedString += " " + token;
            } else {
                args.push_back(token);
            }
        }
    }

    return args;
}

Are these two portions of code, one from the existing Cmd.cpp code  and the other one that's recent that both deal with tokens are independent or are they trying to do the same job?  Is parseCommand() superfluous with the new run() and tokenize?  Also in send()is sendFrame() supposed to be the current method transmitFrame()?

In the main program should there be lines that create the commands send and recv that will then have Command class objects and their function pointers will have to be passed in at that time?

////////////////////////

I thought commands used the command pattern and were created this way:

        commandProcessor.addCommand("dce_transmit", [&dce0](const std::vector<std::string>& args) {
            if (args.size() < 3) {
                std::cerr << "Error: Insufficient arguments for transmission. Usage: dce_transmit <srcMac> <dstMac> <data>" << std::endl;
                return;
            }
            
            std::array<uint8_t, 6> srcMac;
            std::array<uint8_t, 6> dstMac;
            std::vector<uint8_t> payload(args[2].begin(), args[2].end());
            
            // Convert MAC addresses from string to byte array
            sscanf(args[0].c_str(), "%hhx:%hhx:%hhx:%hhx:%hhx:%hhx", &srcMac[0], &srcMac[1], &srcMac[2], &srcMac[3], &srcMac[4], &srcMac[5]);
            sscanf(args[1].c_str(), "%hhx:%hhx:%hhx:%hhx:%hhx:%hhx", &dstMac[0], &dstMac[1], &dstMac[2], &dstMac[3], &dstMac[4], &dstMac[5]);
            
            EthernetFrame frame(srcMac, dstMac, payload);
            dce0->transmitFrame(frame);
            std::cout << "Transmitted data: " << args[2] << std::endl;
        });


I'm confused now. I was pretty happy with having a Command pattern made in large part for it's addCommand() character and it's commands collection with the Command object referenced there.  If these send and recv commands aren't like that then I think we should reconsider implementing them.  I'm not opposed to it but I'd at the same time like to have every single command have commonallity and I'd like send and recv prepackaged, but really absolutely no different than any other command.  It's important now because of the future intent of the mpp and in particular the cmd.  There's be user-defined commands, a DSL and some Lua scripting handled by the cmd in the future and the character and ethos of mpp is inline with each and every command has to go through the Command pattern part of the mpp/cmd code.

/////////////////////////

Why don't we just add them like this for now:

        commandProcessor.addCommand("dce_transmit", [&dce0](const std::vector<std::string>& args) {
            if (args.size() < 3) {
                std::cerr << "Error: Insufficient arguments for transmission. Usage: dce_transmit <srcMac> <dstMac> <data>" << std::endl;
                return;
            }
            
            std::array<uint8_t, 6> srcMac;
            std::array<uint8_t, 6> dstMac;
            std::vector<uint8_t> payload(args[2].begin(), args[2].end());
            
            // Convert MAC addresses from string to byte array
            sscanf(args[0].c_str(), "%hhx:%hhx:%hhx:%hhx:%hhx:%hhx", &srcMac[0], &srcMac[1], &srcMac[2], &srcMac[3], &srcMac[4], &srcMac[5]);
            sscanf(args[1].c_str(), "%hhx:%hhx:%hhx:%hhx:%hhx:%hhx", &dstMac[0], &dstMac[1], &dstMac[2], &dstMac[3], &dstMac[4], &dstMac[5]);
            
            EthernetFrame frame(srcMac, dstMac, payload);
            dce0->transmitFrame(frame);
            std::cout << "Transmitted data: " << args[2] << std::endl;
        });

I'm happy with that way.  For now it's great.  It's crude but still pretty tamed down considering what a nightmare some systems can be.  Later on it can get cleaned up but for now let's just through the commands in like we did with dce_transmit.  The way I see it, if I'm not mistaken, a programmer just has to deal with a little bit of a funny arrangement of code and a rare looking function call like this:

commandProcessor.addCommand("dce_transmit", [&dce0](const std::vector<std::string>& args) {

But it made a collection of commands with names and a func pointer and good enough for now and maybe forever.

In the Cmd constructor could we keep the old addCommand() method and invoke it from there to create our send and recv commands with there funcion pointers?  I thougt that a function pointer was just the functions name and if that's the case then we wouldn't have to put the command execution logic in that "in-line" manner as shown above anyway, would we?  I'd like to make it neat, but still use the Command pattern and Command class here in Cmd and the commands collection.

So we need parseCommand() back.  Ok I'll keep parseCommand().  I'm eager to hear what you think about keeping addCommand() too.

//////////

Does the command send then execute the same logic further down the one eventually that out dce_transmit command did, in particular the transmitFrame() method?  I got a bit lost trying to follow through with the difference between send and transmit and certain similarities between things that I'm used to yet and I a bit mixed up.  But I hope you've got things straighter than me but regardless we have to get in-line and on the same page before I drop this new code in.

If I were to put this new Cmd code in then could I issue:

send <srcMac> <dstMac> <payload>

and it would invoke transmitFrame()?

///////////////

But there is no sendFrame().  Not in EthernetFrame class nor anywhere else.  Can we just plain and simply make sendFrame() transmitFrame() and it'll work like it should, won't it?

Couldn't I just leave every thing except for the Cmd constructor the same as it is right now with main() looking like this:

nt main() {
    try {
        std::string tap0 = createTapDevice("tap0");
        std::string tap1 = createTapDevice("tap1");

        // Initialize libnet
        char errbuf[LIBNET_ERRBUF_SIZE];
        libnet_t *lnet0 = libnet_init(LIBNET_LINK, tap0.c_str(), errbuf);
        libnet_t *lnet1 = libnet_init(LIBNET_LINK, tap1.c_str(), errbuf);
        if (!lnet0 || !lnet1) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Failed to initialize libnet: " + std::string(errbuf));
        }

        // Create DCE instances for each TAP device
        auto dce0 = std::make_shared<DCE>(tap0);
        auto dce1 = std::make_shared<DCE>(tap1);

        // Create Observers for each DCE instance
        auto observer0 = std::make_shared<RxObserver>();
        auto observer1 = std::make_shared<RxObserver>();

        // Attach Observers
        dce0->attach(observer0);

        dce0->startCapture();

                std::cerr << "Error: Insufficient arguments for transmission. Usage: dce_transmit <srcMac> <dstMac> <data>" << std::endl;
                return;
            }
            
            std::array<uint8_t, 6> srcMac;
            std::array<uint8_t, 6> dstMac;

    std::istringstream iss(str);

    return tokens;
}

and it looks like it would tie into my existing cmd because it creates the 6 taps (so that could come out of main) and forces the send and recv commands to go throught the Command pattern process and get stuffed into the commands map like any other command.  It uses that parse command and I could keep the existing one or switch over to this one with all the "token" lingo, depending on which is overall better.

So maybe we could have a main() that does quite a bit of the instantiation and initialization and kicking off processes work and Cmd does a bit but as messy as it might look it's proven, and not disgustingly messy, is it?  Let's find a way using more of what we already have like addCommand(), parseCommand() and a Cmd constructor for some of the work too.

Like I said, I get a little mixed up.  Keep that in mind and be a bit forgiving in precision to understand it best.

//////////////////////////

What do you think of this?  Perhaps I'll do main somnething like this:

int main() {
    try {
        std::string tap0 = system("ip link set tap0 up");
        std::string tap1 = system("ip link set tap1 up");
        std::string tap2 = system("ip link set tap2 up");
        std::string tap3 = system("ip link set tap3 up");
        std::string tap4 = system("ip link set tap4 up");
        std::string tap5 = system("ip link set tap5 up");

        // The libnet initializing that was here I think should be 
        // done in the DCE constructor.  It's was also duplicated in
        // the Cmd constructor.  The Cmd construcrtor can do
        // addCommands() but I think DCE should initialize the taps 
        // with libnet and pcap

        // Create DCE instances for each TAP device
        auto dce0 = std::make_shared<DCE>(tap0);
        auto dce1 = std::make_shared<DCE>(tap1);
        auto dce2 = std::make_shared<DCE>(tap2);
        auto dce3 = std::make_shared<DCE>(tap3);
        auto dce4 = std::make_shared<DCE>(tap4);
        auto dce5 = std::make_shared<DCE>(tap5);

        // Create Observers for each DCE instance
        auto observer0 = std::make_shared<RxObserver>();
        auto observer1 = std::make_shared<RxObserver>();
        auto observer2 = std::make_shared<RxObserver>();
        auto observer3 = std::make_shared<RxObserver>();
        auto observer4 = std::make_shared<RxObserver>();
        auto observer5 = std::make_shared<RxObserver>();

        // Attach Observers
        dce0->attach(observer0);
        dce1->attach(observer1);
        dce2->attach(observer2);
        dce3->attach(observer3);
        dce4->attach(observer4);
        dce5->attach(observer5);

        // Start packet capture
        dce0->startCapture();
        dce1->startCapture();
        dce2->startCapture();
        dce3->startCapture();
        dce4->startCapture();
        dce5->startCapture();

        // Don't need the addComand() stuff here now, done in Cmd
        Cmd commandProcessor; // This constructo will create commands
        std::cout << "DCE is running.\nEnter command: " << std::endl;
        std::string input;
        while (std::getline(std::cin, input)) {
            if(input == "exit")
            {
                break;
            }
            commandProcessor.executeCommand(input);
            std::cout << "Enter command: " << std::endl;
        }

        // Stop packet capture
        dce0->stopCapture();
        dce1->stopCapture();
        dce2->stopCapture();
        dce3->stopCapture();
        dce4->stopCapture();
        dce5->stopCapture();

        // The cleanup libnet stuff that was here can go to the DCE
        // destructor.

    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

Pasting in those createTapDevice() lines above made my wonder if our taps have mac addresses assigned to them:

std::string createTapDevice(const std::string& tapName) {
    int tap_fd = open("/dev/net/tun", O_RDWR);
    if (tap_fd < 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Failed to open /dev/net/tun");
    }

    struct ifreq ifr = {};
    std::strncpy(ifr.ifr_name, tapName.c_str(), IFNAMSIZ);
    ifr.ifr_flags = IFF_TAP | IFF_NO_PI;

    if (ioctl(tap_fd, TUNSETIFF, &ifr) < 0) {
        close(tap_fd);
        throw std::runtime_error("Failed to create TAP device " + tapName);
    }

    // Bring the interface up
    std::string cmd = "ip link set " + tapName + " up";
    if (std::system(cmd.c_str()) != 0) {
        close(tap_fd);
        throw std::runtime_error("Failed to bring TAP device up");
    }

    std::cout << "Created TAP device: " << tapName << std::endl;
    return tapName;
}

When I've stepped through it with the debugger it's the system call that's responsible for creating the tap.  Does that mean that all the low level stuff isn't don't by our code.  Maybe I'd get by with just system calls, like I have above in the proposed main.

Functionally if I did main() the way it is above, create and initialize the 6 taps in DCE and destroy them in the DCE destructor and create the commands send and recv in the Cmd constructor the wouldn't I have 6 bidirectional channels like I want for cmd?

And here's another thought.  If I ship cmd with the main() like I just described which is functional, not shameful, but could use improvement it might feed into the bios model because I have every intention of building and os on top of this cmd core component and at some point I can upgrade the bios and swap it out later through some sort of clever mechanism.  It'll be fun.

//////////////////////

There's a slight error with the Cmd constructor or lack thereof:

src/main.cpp: In function ‘int main()’:
src/main.cpp:29:37: error: no matching function for call to ‘Cmd::Cmd(std::vector<std::shared_ptr<DCE> >&)’
   29 |         Cmd commandProcessor(dceList);

In file included from src/main.cpp:6:
include/Cmd.hpp:8:7: note: candidate: ‘Cmd::Cmd()’
    8 | class Cmd {
      |       ^~~

I'd like to use that nice neat main() that you made for me so I hope you can solve this compile error.

Then we'll have to head over to DCE and make sure it's constructor creates taps, gives them mac addresses (let's hard code them according to the tap-to-mac table for cmd for now) and initializes them with libnet and pcap.  And then I think we'll have to finish off with Cmd constructor who will make the send and recv commands and connect send to transmitFrame() and recv to getNextPacket() or some such similar thing.

/////////////////////

Hi partner, it's morning for me again and I'm happy and excited to put your latest files to work, but I'm having trouble not getting confused, and I'm almost certain to make a mess.

The new Cmd.cpp and DCE.cpp look like a solid effort in creating some SoC where some was needed in getting all the tap and libnet stuff over into DCE (an observer subject, if I'm not mistaken) and getting the command stuff in Cmd.

Some of the Cmd methods that are presently in place need to stay like parseCommand(), but they have an inferior replacement, as I understand, so 

std::vector<std::string> Cmd::tokenize(const std::string& str) {
    std::vector<std::string> tokens;
    std::istringstream iss(str);
    std::string token;
    while (iss >> token) tokens.push_back(token);
    return tokens;
}

void Cmd::run() {
    std::string command;
    while (true) {
        std::cout << "cmd> ";
        std::getline(std::cin, command);
        
        if (command == "exit") break;
        
        auto tokens = tokenize(command);
        if (!tokens.empty()) {
            executeCommand(tokens[0], std::vector<std::string>(tokens.begin() + 1, tokens.end()));
        } else {
            std::cout << "Unknown command.\n";
        }
    }
}

as I understand should be replaced by something like the old way, but here in Cmd, instead of where it used to be we should have a run/parseCommand/args whereas above there is a run/tokenize/token setup:

std::vector<std::string> parseCommand(const std::string& input) {
    std::vector<std::string> args;
    std::istringstream iss(input);
    std::string token;
    bool inQuotes = false;
    std::string quotedString;

    while (std::getline(iss, token, ' ')) {  // Read tokens by space
        if (!token.empty()) {
            if (token.front() == '"' && !inQuotes) {
                inQuotes = true;
                quotedString = token.substr(1);  // Remove leading quote
            } else if (token.back() == '"' && inQuotes) {
                inQuotes = false;
                quotedString += " " + token.substr(0, token.length() - 1);  // Remove trailing quote
                args.push_back(quotedString);
            } else if (inQuotes) {
                quotedString += " " + token;
            } else {
                args.push_back(token);
            }
        }
    }

    return args;
}

void Cmd::run() {
    std::string command;
    while (true) {
        std::cout << "cmd> ";
        std::getline(std::cin, command);
        
        if (command == "exit") break;
        
        auto tokens = tokenize(command);
        if (!tokens.empty()) {
            executeCommand(tokens[0], std::vector<std::string>(tokens.begin() + 1, tokens.end()));
        } else {
            std::cout << "Unknown command.\n";
        }
    }
}

And I'd like to separate the implementations from the declarations and the Cmd constructor I don't know how to separate when it's written like this:

    Cmd::Cmd(std::vector<std::shared_ptr<DCE>>& dces) : dceList(dces) {


And then there's DCE and all of the place holder in the methods, which isn't a big deal on its own but the amount of shuffling around of code it looks like I have to do will be very error prone, especially when I didn't write the code and don't have as deep of a feel for the code and the associations and relationships between all of the program code elements.

I'd like you to look at my existing code and your latest proposed code and fix the run/tokenize/token arrangement in Cmd and make it the one we agree is superior which is the run/parseCommand/args arrangement.  Split the Cmd constructor into declaration and implementation in Cmd.hpp and Cmd.cpp respectively.

So, if I'm not mistaken, Cmd should end up having:

Cmd()
addCommand()
send
recv
run()
parseCommand()
executeCommand()

DCE now has getNextPacket() and that used to be in RxObserver and I'm not sure how to move that or if it even has to be moved.

Anyway, we have to figure out a way for you to do the coding of all of this mixing together of how things are and how they should be between Cmd.cpp, Cmd.hpp, DCE.cpp, DCE.hpp, RxObserver and main().  If it easy for you to do, please just go ahead and do it otherwise let's consult with each other on how we can work together to facilitate this.

////////////////////

Hey nice job on refactoring into the neater and more compact form.  The main() is a lot nicer and responsibilities are satisfyingly appropriate.  There's something really satisgying about how you separated COM (btw way I've changed DCE to COM, and dces to coms and DCE.cpp top COM.cpp and DCE.hpp to COm.hpp) and Cmd and how Cmd has it's good ol' parseCommand() back - you and I worked too hard on the nice little helper function parsesCommand() to just brush it aside in a refactoring and I'm glad you put it back in place.

I'm having a bit of trouble presently with COM::transmitFrame() because it's like this in COM:

void transmitFrame(const std::string &dstMac, const std::string &data);

and it's like this in DCE:

void DCE::transmitFrame(const EthernetFrame& frame) {

Would you be able to resolve this in a comprehensive non-breaking way?  Buy non-breaking I mean taking into account all of cmd, not just COM or not just what's immediate and close.

I think these from DCE:

    void attach(std::shared_ptr<IObserver> observer) override;
    void detach(std::shared_ptr<IObserver> observer) override;
    void notify(const std::vector<uint8_t>& packet) override;
    void startCapture();
    void stopCapture();

need moved to COM, right?  Can you do that too?

This is my only compiler error now.  Hey if this works then we'll be able to expand this version of Cmd to 6 COMs wide.  I think now it's only 2 wide.  But we're really on the home stretch to getting a deliverable Cmd component and getting on with the rest of mpp, right partner?

When this compiler error is resolved will we have pretty much what we were looking for?  Which is 6 bidirectional ethernet taps each with individual software control through a Command pattern controlled command mechanism offering tx and rx commands and an Observer pattern controlled RxBuffer.  Am I right about this?  If so then we'll have accomplished the Cmd and we should start thinking about where we're going to go next.  We'll have to talk about the CNL and HUD.

Here's a rough ascii art rendition up of the Heads-Up Display ethernet transaction visualization tool part of the MPP.  It'll be programmed in ncurses and the data displayed is just example data and reality it might end up being only one channel per hud instance.  Btw, the vertical parts are channels.  In particular the area between pipes, labelled with TX in one and RX in the other are the channels and representitive of the actual ethernet cable's TX and TX channels.  The MPPs user defined commands, DSL and Lua scripts will describe what the system does with regards to incoming and outgoing ethernet traffic.  For instance a user could use the user defined commands and/or the DSL and/or Lua scripting (all handled in the Cmd component) to describe a ping and then in running that scenario the CNL and HUD would work together supplied by the NET with network traffic and supplied with instructions from CMD to monitor, visualize and perhaps modify, intervene or initiate network phenomenon.  The CNL delays the traffic from NET to HUD by a slight bit in order to prepare for the oncoming visualizatiion in the HUD.  It's still a vague idea but these scenarios will possibly be complex and powerful but perhaps something like a goal-based process where the input to CNL from CMD telling it the scenario has goals in it that the CNL monitors for and it gives HUD time code information about the meeting of goals, or timeouts or whatever so that when the delayed packet with the time code of the goal event arrives HUD will know how to display the appropriate channel, display alarms, green, red, show data, whatever.

Now I look in Cmd and I see run is empty.  Here's parseCommand and how it was used in Cmd back when we had DCE and this big main():

std::vector<std::string> parseCommand(const std::string& input) {
    std::vector<std::string> args;
    std::istringstream iss(input);
    std::string token;
    bool inQuotes = false;
    std::string quotedString;

    while (std::getline(iss, token, ' ')) {  // Read tokens by space
        if (!token.empty()) {
            if (token.front() == '"' && !inQuotes) {
                inQuotes = true;
                quotedString = token.substr(1);  // Remove leading quote
            } else if (token.back() == '"' && inQuotes) {
                inQuotes = false;
                quotedString += " " + token.substr(0, token.length() - 1);  // Remove trailing quote
                args.push_back(quotedString);
            } else if (inQuotes) {
                quotedString += " " + token;
            } else {
                args.push_back(token);
            }
        }
    }

    return args;
}

Back then we had pieces of code in inappropriate places so this is how parseCommand was called in Cmd.cpp:

void Cmd::executeCommand(const std::string& name) const {
    std::vector<std::string> args = parseCommand(name);
    
    if (args.empty()) {
        std::cerr << "Error: Empty command string" << std::endl;
        return;
    }

    std::string commandName = args[0];  // First argument is the command name

    auto it = commands.find(commandName);
    if (it != commands.end()) {
        args.erase(args.begin());  // Remove command name from args before passing
        it->second.execute(args);
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Command not found: " << commandName << std::endl;
    }
}

But the thing is that it really worked good for handling the command line so we should reuse it.  It's just that in the new refactored Cmd and the Cmd class in particular I don't know how to use it.

This is the current Cmd.hpp:

#ifndef CMD_HPP
#define CMD_HPP

#include "Command.hpp"
#include "COM.hpp"
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <memory>
#include <functional>
#include <string>

class Cmd {
public:
    explicit Cmd(std::vector<std::shared_ptr<COM>>& dces);
    void addCommand(const std::string& name, std::function<void(const std::vector<std::string>&)> func);
    void run();

private:
    std::unordered_map<std::string, Command> commands;
    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<COM>> dceList;
};

#endif // CMD_HPP

and this is the current Cmd.cpp:

#include "Cmd.hpp"
#include <iostream>

Cmd::Cmd(std::vector<std::shared_ptr<COM>>& coms) : dceList(coms) {}

void Cmd::addCommand(const std::string& name, std::function<void(const std::vector<std::string>&)> func) {
    commands.emplace(name, Command(name, func));
}

void Cmd::run() {
    std::cout << "Cmd loop running..." << std::endl;
    // Implement command execution loop here
}

At one point in the various iterations of the evolution the Cmd class constructor created the Command object that were the commands send() and recv() and those two commands will be hooked to transmitFrame() and getNextPacket() right?  Remember when it was something like that?

It looks like out present Cmd class needs an addCommand() method and a executeCommand() method,if I'm not mistaken.

Can you plese fix these problems?

Oh no, guess what, I forgot about TAP initialization in Cmd::Cmd().  I found out quickly when I went to step through execution with the VSCode debugger.  I've got it something like this but it's wrong:

COM::COM(const std::string& tapName, const std::string& macAddress) 
    : tapName(tapName), macAddress(macAddress) {
    if (!initializeTAP()) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Failed to initialize TAP device " + tapName);
    }
    if (!initializeLibnet()) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Failed to initialize libnet: " + std::string(errbuf));
    }
    if (!initializePcap()) {
        pcapHandle = pcap_open_live(tapName.c_str(), BUFSIZ, 1, 1000, errbuf);
        if (!pcapHandle) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Failed to open TAP device for pcap: " + std::string(errbuf));
        }
    }
    std::cout << "COM initialized for " << tapName << " with MAC " << macAddress << "\n";
}

std::string COM::initializeTAP() {
    int tap_fd = open("/dev/net/tun", O_RDWR);
    if (tap_fd < 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Failed to open /dev/net/tun");
    }

    struct ifreq ifr = {};
    std::strncpy(ifr.ifr_name, tapName, IFNAMSIZ);
    ifr.ifr_flags = IFF_TAP | IFF_NO_PI;

    if (ioctl(tap_fd, TUNSETIFF, &ifr) < 0) {
        close(tap_fd);
        throw std::runtime_error("Failed to create TAP device " + tapName);
    }

    // Bring the interface up
    std::string cmd = "ip link set " + tapName + " up";
    if (std::system(cmd.c_str()) != 0) {
        close(tap_fd);
        throw std::runtime_error("Failed to bring TAP device up");
    }

    std::cout << "Created TAP device: " << tapName << std::endl;
    return tapName;
}

bool COM::initializeLibnet() {
    lnet = libnet_init(LIBNET_LINK, tapName.c_str(), errbuf);
    if (!lnet) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Failed to initialize libnet: " + std::string(libnet_geterror(lnet)));
    }
    std::cout << "Initializing libnet for " << tapName << "\n";
    return true;
}

bool COM::initializePcap() {
    std::cout << "Initializing pcap for " << tapName << "\n";
    return !tapName.empty();
}

The code I got for the screwed up initializeTAP() I got from the createTapDevice() that was above main() in the DCE days:

std::string createTapDevice(const std::string& tapName) {
    int tap_fd = open("/dev/net/tun", O_RDWR);
    if (tap_fd < 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Failed to open /dev/net/tun");
    }

    struct ifreq ifr = {};
    std::strncpy(ifr.ifr_name, tapName.c_str(), IFNAMSIZ);
    ifr.ifr_flags = IFF_TAP | IFF_NO_PI;

    if (ioctl(tap_fd, TUNSETIFF, &ifr) < 0) {
        close(tap_fd);
        throw std::runtime_error("Failed to create TAP device " + tapName);
    }

    // Bring the interface up
    std::string cmd = "ip link set " + tapName + " up";
    if (std::system(cmd.c_str()) != 0) {
        close(tap_fd);
        throw std::runtime_error("Failed to bring TAP device up");
    }

    std::cout << "Created TAP device: " << tapName << std::endl;
    return tapName;
}

Of course the new type of initializeTAP returns a bool, which looks a bit slicker.

While we're at it, can you create all six right now, instead of just the two.  Weren't we going to store the 6 mac addresses in #define macros?  Correct me if I'm wrong but can't we ignore the tap-to-mac table for now because at the low level we're dealing with a physical device sounding name is appropriate tap0, tap1, ... tap5.  Feel free to give them default mac addresses of your choice.

I don't know wht to do about those tapFd errors.

//////////////////////////////

I'm naming MAC addresses in two places, main and COM.hpp it seems.  Main has this:

int main() {
    try {
        // Initialize DCE instances
        std::vector<std::shared_ptr<COM>> coms;
        coms.push_back(std::make_shared<COM>("tap0", "00:11:22:33:44:00"));
        coms.push_back(std::make_shared<COM>("tap1", "00:11:22:33:44:01"));
        coms.push_back(std::make_shared<COM>("tap2", "00:11:22:33:44:02"));
        coms.push_back(std::make_shared<COM>("tap3", "00:11:22:33:44:03"));
        coms.push_back(std::make_shared<COM>("tap4", "00:11:22:33:44:04"));
        coms.push_back(std::make_shared<COM>("tap5", "00:11:22:33:44:05"));

        // Initialize command interface
        Cmd cmd(coms);
        
        // Run the command loop
        cmd.run();
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    
    return 0;
}

and COM.hpp has this:

constexpr std::array<const char*, 6> MAC_ADDRESSES = {
    "00:11:22:33:44:00", "00:11:22:33:44:01", "00:11:22:33:44:02",
    "00:11:22:33:44:03", "00:11:22:33:44:04", "00:11:22:33:44:05"
};

and Cmd.cpp has this:

Cmd::Cmd(std::vector<std::shared_ptr<COM>>& coms) : dceList(coms) {

    try {

        for (int i = 0; i < 6; ++i) {
            dceList.emplace_back(std::make_unique<COM>("tap" + std::to_string(i), MAC_ADDRESSES[i]));
        }

        std::cout << "All TAP devices initialized successfully.\n";
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error initializing TAPs: " << e.what() << "\n";
        throw;  // Fail early if TAP setup is broken
    }

So somewhere things are getting mixed up and I hope you can quickly fix, which I have confidence in.  Incidentally we should change dceList to comList either now or later some time.

Here's terminal output, which looks very nice until I hit the Cmd constructor in main():

Created TAP device: tap0
Libnet initialized for tap0
Pcap initialized for tap0
COM initialized for tap0 with MAC 00:11:22:33:44:00
Created TAP device: tap1
Libnet initialized for tap1
Pcap initialized for tap1
COM initialized for tap1 with MAC 00:11:22:33:44:01
Created TAP device: tap2
Libnet initialized for tap2
Pcap initialized for tap2
COM initialized for tap2 with MAC 00:11:22:33:44:02
Created TAP device: tap3
Libnet initialized for tap3
Pcap initialized for tap3
COM initialized for tap3 with MAC 00:11:22:33:44:03
Created TAP device: tap4
Libnet initialized for tap4
Pcap initialized for tap4
COM initialized for tap4 with MAC 00:11:22:33:44:04
Created TAP device: tap5
Libnet initialized for tap5
Pcap initialized for tap5
COM initialized for tap5 with MAC 00:11:22:33:44:05

It crashed in the Cmd constructor the very first time it tries doing this:

        for (int i = 0; i < 6; ++i) {
            dceList.emplace_back(std::make_unique<COM>("tap" + std::to_string(i), MAC_ADDRESSES[i]));
        }

All the taps vanish from wireshark and the program crashes out.

I have the MAC_ADDRESSES in COM.hpp:

constexpr std::array<const char*, 6> MAC_ADDRESSES = {
    "00:11:22:33:44:00", "00:11:22:33:44:01", "00:11:22:33:44:02",
    "00:11:22:33:44:03", "00:11:22:33:44:04", "00:11:22:33:44:05"
};

It looks like it's trying to reinitialize everything because the line above causes this in the program output:

Failed to create TAP device tap0
Error initializing TAPs: Failed to initialize TAP device tap0
Error: Failed to initialize TAP device tap0

Well I'm stepping through program execution and trying to do a send command.  I've tried the following:

>send 0 00:11:22:33:44:02 00:11:22:33:44:01 "Hello tap1, from tap0!!!"

>send 0 0x00:0x11:0x22:0x33:0x44:0x02 0x00:0x11:0x22:0x33:0x44:0x01 0x48:0x65:0x6c:0x6c:0x6f:0x20:0x74:0x61:0x70:0x31:0x2c:0x20:0x66:0x72:0x6f:0x6d:0x20:0x74:0x61:0x70:0x30:0x21:0x21:0x21

It crashes out and kills all the taps in about the third iteration of this for loop.



        for (int i = 0; i < 6; ++i) {
            dstMac[i] = static_cast<uint8_t>(std::stoi(args[i + 1], nullptr, 16));

Before your helper function and just the information from you about the format it expects the input line:

With this input:
send "00" "00", "11", "22", "33", "44", "02" "00", "11", "22", "33", "44", "01" "48", "65", "6c", "6c", "6f", "20", "74", "61", "70", "31", "2c", "20", "66", "72", "6f", "6d", "20", "74", "61", "70", "30", "21", "21", "21"


These were the args at parse dst mac and notice that the arg[0] still has the dce index:

arg[0] = "00\" \"00\", \"11\", \"22\", \"33\", \"44\", \"02"

arg[1] = 00\", \"11\", \"22\", \"33\", \"44\", \"01"

arg[2] = "48\", \"65\", \"6c\", \"6c\", \"6f\", \"20\", \"74\", \"61\", \"70\", \"31\", \"2c\", \"20\", \"66\", \"72\", \"6f\", \"6d\", \"20\", \"74\", \"61\", \"70\", \"30\", \"21\", \"21\", \"21"

So I put in the lovely new parseMacAddress() and now I get this error:

It's looking really good.  I'm putting in this for input:

send 0 00:11:22:33:44:02 00:11:22:33:44:01 48:65:6c:6c:6f:20:74:61:70:31:2c:20:66:72:6f:6d:20:74:61:70:30:21:21:21

and the two macs and the type(ipv4 = 0x0800) is captured by wireshark.  But this code:

        for (size_t i = 13; i < args.size(); ++i) {
            payload.push_back(static_cast<uint8_t>(std::stoi(args[i], nullptr, 16)));
        }

skips over the payload handling.  What it wants for data to transmit which is:

arg[3] = "48:65:6c:6c:6f:20:74:61:70:31:2c:20:66:72:6f:6d:20:74:61:70:30:21:21:21"

////////////////////////////////

I'd like to familiarize you with my code base, which is fairly small... it's basically an Observer pattern to receive ethernet and a command pattern to issue commands such as send and recv and when the send command is issued send ethernet.  When I transfer the code over to you hopefully the intent will be clear.  There are 13 files all together, 7 .hpp files and 6 .cpp files, but most of the action happens in main.cpp, COM.cpp and Cmd.cpp.  I guess I've been inadvertently trialing my own program recently while trying to get the linux tun/tap working for my IPC and so I think not only will I want you to work on refactoring for this program to use TCP IPC in place of the linux tap ethernet I'd hoped to but also I think there will need to be a new strategy for other things such as the creation of sockets instead of taps, the initialization of things such as sockets, libnet, pcap etc.  Also, I don't know why or how the method getNextPacket() got into COM.hpp and so I'd like you also to reconcile with the getNextPacket() in RxObserver.  You may as well investigate what the method packetHandler() in COM.hpp is for too.

Before I send the code to you though I'd like us to discuss this project a bit and refine our requirements and take stock of what we got.

This program I call Cmd and it's just one of of four components that make up the whole project called mpp.  The Cmd, however, in its current state will be common among all the other components and then the plan is that all of the 4 components then specialize in one thing, and the Cmd module goes on to specialize as a command mechanism, the details of which aren't important now.  One I have the Cmd module working up to a certain level of funcionality I'll then clone it into the other components' repos.  But for now I'd like to get this Cmd component kitted out with the simple Command pattern command mechanism including a tx command, send, and the Observer pattern for the receiver and the command recv.  I want the Cmd component to have 6 TCP channels now, instead of the tun/tap channels, and act like DTE/DCE pairs so that each of the 4 components can configure a full-duplex DTE/DCE relationship with the neighboring components.  I don't want any kind of flow control, no handshaking, just fire-and-forget, if that's possible.  I want it to be reckless and for all the responsibilities to be passed to future higher levels of software which can implement the send and recv commands appropriately to acheive the communications desired.

How would you like to receive the files?  Even though there are 13 files there isn't very much data to transfer and I could do it all in chat in a single transfer just by separating the files with // filename.xxx
or something.  Or maybe you'd prefer using the + button and doing an upload, but since I'm not a paying user I might be severely limited in that mechanism.

This should be lots of fun, partner.  If we can work quickly, before our session get too old and slow and sluggish maybe we'll go on to work on integrating all the 4 components.

Ok, that's a pretty good take on things.

At one point you said that each component creates TCP links to each of its two neighbors but in the mpp all four components are neighbors, I wasn't clear on that and I apologize.  So the Cmd will have 6 TCP channels a DTE/DCE pair for each of the other three components totalling 6.

I don't want the Command class to have anything more than it has now... not at this point anyhow.

At some point in the future, when I get the linux tap figured out, I'd like to use ethernet for IPC.  Now that we're going with TCP, however, I'd like to do it in a way that it could be switched to ethernet easily.  Like maybe we can do Ethernet over TCP and maybe we could even make the TCP part transparent.

I'm not particlar about using libnet and/or pcap, and they're probably not needed anymore now that sockets are getting the call to action, right?

As far as handling dropped connections goes let's just not really consider it for now.  During the setting up of connections we should report on failure but after that it's the users responsibility and can use linux tools of various sorts, or perhaps other programs to monitor the program's execution.  I don't want complexity at this point.  I want things very simple where basically it's just 6 TCP connections.  The existing commands are:

send which takes arguments of channel, dstMac, srcMac and payload.  Here's an example:

send 0 02:00:00:00:01:01 02:00:00:00:00:01 48:65:6C:6C:6F:20:63:6D:64:30:20:66:72:6F:6D:20:68:75:64:30:20:21:21:21

recv takes one argument for the channel, 0-5 and returns the oldest packet in the RxBuffer.

I'm no expert on IP addresses but I think I'd like addresses in the 10's as I see many examples of experimental code using the 10's such as:

Cmd:
10.0.0.1
10.0.0.2
10.0.0.3
10.0.0.4
10.0.0.5
10.0.0.6

At some point I'll clone the Cmd repo into another directory and we'll simulate other coponents such as the hud component, the net component or the Cnl component and we'll then assign address in those clone directories such as:

Hud:
10.0.1.1
10.0.1.2
10.0.1.3
10.0.1.4
10.0.1.5
10.0.1.6

etc....

I'm a rooky at TCP and so I'll defer to your wisdom regarding the creation of the TCP channels.  I hope that the requirements will steer your judgement over how to handle creation, ownership and lifecycle of the TCP channels.

Great questions!  I'm enjoying our chat.  I'm eager to hear your comments and questions.

///////////////////////////////////////

I've got a feeling that things will make more sense if we talk more in terms of UDP and less in terms of TCP.  I just looked up UDP.  I'm looking for a method where a channel can be created and traffic can be sent on it without any care at all where it's going.  Also, I'd like the listeners to receive on channels whether there is an active sender or not.  If traffic arrives fine, if it doesn't that's fine to.  The user will issue recv commands as he sees fit and issue send commands as he sees fit.  Keep in mind that in the current implemtation of these channels the intent is that the rx direction is not used.  When the cmd component, for instance, transmits to the hud, cnl or net components it'll use one of the UDP channels that it thinks of as the DTE in the DTE/DCE pair going to and coming from each other component and uses the tx side of the UDP channel to do so, but isn't concerned about the rx channel, even though there's one there.  Is this possible in UDP?  To operate recklessly like that?  Unidirectionally?  I'm a rooky with UDP and TCP and socket programming in general and I'm not even sure if what I'm trying to achieve is possible with UDPs or TCP.

Is this architecture taking shape?  I'd like to hear your questions and comments.

//////////////////////////////////////////

You comment here is spot on:

This makes sure all sending is one-way only, with no "feedback loop" unless a higher layer decides to do so.

Yes.  The way I want what we're doing with cmd might seem sloppy and silly but just think of it as a very low level component and all of the worry of protocol, for instance, has to be handled by software using the send and recv commands.  I'm open to the idea of maybe having a separate command or two like, maybe for instance, ping.  But that's what the Command pattern can be used for later - adding another command to the Command objects.

I like your idea for addressing so just go ahead with that.  Yeah the Cmd can be this:

10.0.0.1:5000  (Channel 0)
10.0.0.1:5001  (Channel 1)
10.0.0.1:5002  (Channel 2)
10.0.0.1:5003  (Channel 3)
10.0.0.1:5004  (Channel 4)
10.0.0.1:5005  (Channel 5)

and we can work out addresses for the others after we clone and set them up.

With regards to your code generation would you like to keep any of the code and/or files from the existing code that I sent to you or would you like to start fresh?  One way we can transfer the code you generate to me is in chat or canvas you put all of the implementations right in the declarations all in one file called main.cpp and you can wire it together in the main().  I can then split it apart into separtate .hpp and .cpp files, on a per class basis.

Do you think you understand the problem?  Can you restate the problem and then state what your approach to solving it would be, without actually generating the code yet?

////////////////////////////////////////

## Problem Restatement ##

- 2.
Cmd doesn't really ignore the rx channels.  The rx channels are there and perfectly funcional, if a user cares to issue a recv command.  They're not ignored at all, it's just that to begin with at least each of those bi-directional UDP paths will use its tx of its DTE channels and only its rx of its DCE channels.

- 6.
I think we should ditch the mac addresses, and go with ip and port for now.  Sound good?

## Questions Before Proceeding ##

- 1.Markdown: Disable Linting

If recv is called and there is nothing there it just returns empty.

- 2.
I think we should take the mac addresses out of the command.  For now let's take the mac addresses out completely.  For now let's act as though we have no intention of using mac at all and just keep it as simple as possible.

- 3.
We can make a little repl interface as you're inclined.  In Cmd.cpp in the code I sent you was a run() method which is probably somehing like what you're thinking.  The parse helper functions like parseCommand() or parseMacAddress() might be interesting for you to look at - they both worked pretty good.  But it's up to you to use what you want.

//////////////////////////////////

Hey it looks great.  I have it in VSCode and I stepped through it.

It failed with this:

Bind failed: Cannot assign requested address

On this line:

        channels.emplace(i, UDPChannel("10.0.0.1", 5000 + i));

Any idea why that might have been?

///////////////////////////////////

I've altered a line in the code and I wonder what you think of it.  I changed this:

        if (tokens[0] == "send" && tokens.size() == 4) {

to:

        if (tokens[0] == "send" && tokens.size() == 5) {

wondering if there were 5, including send.  It seems to have got it to compile but the programs still fails in that it doesn't send a message but at least it compiles.  In the debugger the values look ok though.

I also changed this:

                SendCommand cmd(channels[ch], "10.0.0.1", 5000 + ch, tokens[3]);

to this:

                SendCommand cmd(channels[ch], "10.0.0.2", 5000 + ch, tokens[3]);

thinking that the dst should probably be 10.0.0.2.

What do you think about the changes I made?

at this point in the code:

    void execute() override { channel.send(dst_ip, dst_port, message); }

the arguments seem to be screwed up because the debugger gives these values:

channel
    - sockfd = 3
    - ip = "0.0.0.0"
    - port 5000

dst_ip = "0.0.0.0"
dst_port = 5000
message = "0.0.0.0"

A definite hint that something is wrong with the argument handling because message I'm pretty sure shouldn't be "0.0.0.0".

Please double check if you expect those values at that point in the code execution.

Can you please double check the correctness of your code from the listing in this message above?

////////////////////////////////////////////////////

At the time this code is executed:

        dest.sin_port = htons(dst_port);
        sendto(sockfd, message.c_str(), message.size(), 0, (struct sockaddr*)&dest, sizeof(dest));

the debugger shows that dest.sin_port = 34835.  I put in 5000 at the command line though.  My command was this:

> send 0 0.0.0.0 5000 hello

Can you send me a fixed gptcmd.cpp please?

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

At the time this line is executed:

        ssize_t bytes_sent = sendto(sockfd, message.c_str(), message.size(), 0, (struct sockaddr*)&dest, sizeof(dest));


the debugger says that:

sockfd = 3
dest.sin_family = 2
dest.sin_port = 34835
dst_ip = "0.0.0.0"
dst_port = 5000
message = "hello"

This is the command I put in:

> send 0 0.0.0.0 5000 hello

and this is the output:

sendto failed: Bad file descriptor
>

Any idea what the problem is, partner?  Please fix it and send me a new updated and all fixed up gptcmd.cpp.

/////////////////////////////////////////////

I ran it and got this again:

> send 0 127.0.0.1 5001 hello
sendto failed: Bad file descriptor

but at the time of execution dest.sin_port = 35091

Also at that time:

this->port = 5000

while:

dst_port = 5000

I'd all of the puzzling numbers I think it's appropriate that there was no traffic seen by wireshark, nor tcpdump.

If you could, partner, I'd like it if you'd send me an updated and fixed gptcmd.cpp please.  Let me know if my feedback is inadequate.  I'm here to support you 100% and I'm grateful for your generosity with your knowledge and capabilities.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Checkout how I changed the code in a couple places.  I commented out your code.  I directly set the port and the dst_port to 5000 and it went into dest.sin_port reading 5000 in the debugger.  I think it's an unsigned int 16 or some sort:

The command I entered was this:

> send 0 127.0.0.1 5000 hello

and I got this output again:

sendto failed: Bad file descriptor

and sockfd = 3, which I think it always does.

Can you figure this out and send me an updated and corrected gptcmd.cpp please, partner?

////////////////////////////////////

In the constructor there's this:

    UDPChannel(const std::string& ip, int port) : ip(ip), port(port) {
        sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
        if (sockfd < 0) {
            perror("Socket creation failed");
            exit(1);
        }

and then in send there's this:

      void send(const std::string& dst_ip, int dst_port, const std::string& message) {
        if (sockfd < 0) {
            std::cerr << "Socket not initialized properly!" << std::endl;
            return;
        }

is the send code rightfully absent this code that's present in the constuctor code:

        sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);

It seems to me that in the debugger the sockfd is always 3 and sockfd 3 seems to be the only one that ever gets allocated.

Hey parter, woo hoo!!!  Crack open the champagne!  Look at the tcpdump output:

and the output:

> recv 1

Great work.  Thanks for the code.

Ok, now that we've figured out this thing all the way through we have the proof of concept a lot further along, wouldn't you say?  And that's just absolutely great and I'm very happy about this.

I have a question though.  I changed the message to "Hello Graham!!!" and then it said the >send command was invalid, because it took Graham!!! as an argument.  Is there a way I can put spaces in the message?  Like an escape sequence or something?  If not it's ok, I'll just use dashes or an underscore or something.

I have this current well working program commited and pushed to github in a repo branch:

https://github.com/ambersoj/cmd/tree/tcp_icp

The local working directory for that branch is /usr/local/cmd_clone/cmd and I'd like to clone it to /usr/local/hud_clone/hud.  Then I want to customize it by changing references to cmd to hud and changing the IP ranges and then try to communicate with the send and recv commands between the two separately running programs, and that, partner, will be our IPC.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Is the getline() method in run() blocking?  I'm curious because the vast majority of the time it will be my programs that issue the send and recv commands and not a user.  Will it be easy to add the hud-specific functionality to the cmd clone that makes up the current state of hud, just with the name changed and the port range starting at 6000 instead of cmd's 5000.  Suggest how you'd go about adding application specific functionality to the cmd core that will be used in all of the other components like hud but also cnl and net.  I just want to make sure that the program doesn't spend very much time waiting for user input because usually the user is a computer process.

////////////////////////////////////

 Oh darn now there's an issue with the prompt character '>' getting printed out every round:  
 
 UDPChannel bound to 127.0.0.1:6000 with sockfd 3 UDPChannel bound to 127.0.0.1:6001 with sockfd 4 UDPChannel bound to 127.0.0.1:6002 with sockfd 5 UDPChannel bound to 127.0.0.1:6003 with sockfd 6 UDPChannel bound to 127.0.0.1:6004 with sockfd 7 UDPChannel bound to 127.0.0.1:6005 with sockfd 8 > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > e> > x> > i> > t>  [1] + Done                       "/usr/bin/gdb" --interpreter=mi --tty=${DbgTerm} 0<"/tmp/Microsoft-MIEngine-In-u0mgqrpe.3ph" 1>"/tmp/Microsoft-MIEngine-Out-3rratmlj.xbb" root@PRED:/usr/local/hud_clone/hud#
 
Also, for now I don't want to run these programs from a script so I don't want to use an environment variable and for now I'd like to just set a PORT_BASE #define macro, if that's possible.  And none of the characters within the programs need to be changed, just the file name so sed never needs to be used, acutally.  It's really really easy to change from cmd to any of the other components, so that's a plus for sure. 

////////////////////////////////////////////////

It's very close now but the prompt character is initially missing, while the command is being entered, and then only shows up infront of the program output as shown below:

UDPChannel bound to 127.0.0.1:6005 with sockfd 8
send 0 127.0.0.1 5001 Hello cmd, from hud!!!
> Sending to 127.0.0.1:5001 via socket 3
send 0 127.0.0.1 5001 Hello cmd, from hud!!!
> Sending to 127.0.0.1:5001 via socket 3

///////////////////////////////////////////

Now with regards to how commands will be most often issued through programs than through user input.  How would you feel about refactoring to use a GoF command pattern complete with a commandInvoker class or a commandInvoker() method that would perform all of the execute() methods of each command in commands?  Would adding an invoker like the GoF Command pattern achieve what we're looking for by way of an entry point for programatically issued commands?

////////////////////////////////////////////////////

See the output log here:

UDPChannel bound to 127.0.0.1:6005 with sockfd 8

It clearly prints the '>' prompt over and over.  At the end you can see how it even mixes in the letters of the command "exit".
