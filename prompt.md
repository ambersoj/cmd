Thanks for the code.  It works great and it's very exciting.  I'm fairly new to design patterns but I"m a big fan.  If one were to compare the description of the Observer pattern in the famous GoF book "Design Patterns" would the Subject be an abstract receive buffer and a DCE be an abstract Observer?

In the DCE class is the run() method where the rest of the system can access the DCE class?  Right now the run() method just prints out a hearbeat every second but is the intention for actual real-world implementation that this run() method be the sort of take-off point for another part of a program to run its logic in it?  Like if this DCE class had libnet and pcap initialization of the tap in the initializeTAP() method along with the fap creation then maybe that run() routine could act like one of the players in the Observer pattern, like maybe a ConcreteObserver?  But don't let me convice or influence you... I don't know, I'm asking

Now what I'd like us to do is get an Observer pattern working so that we have 3 rx buffers that will store what's captured by pcap at a tap and that's all.  Just put the payload in the buffer, no ethernet protocol at all, no time stamp, no nothing, but the payload, preferable in a nice humanly readable form.

That'll be the rx channel for the cmd, that I alone or the both of us together will integrate into the cmd code base.

Don't generate code just yet, partner.  For now I'd like us to talk and answer questions until we're in agreement and up to speed.

///////

Questions Before We Code
How do you want to map TAPs to RX buffers? Should each TAP have exactly one RX buffer, or do multiple DCEs share the same buffer?
Do you want the RX buffers to hold multiple packets, or just the latest payload? (FIFO vs. last-packet-wins)
Should we introduce an event-driven mechanism for notifying Observers? (Or just have the Observers manually check for new data?)

/////////

Ok, I'm glad we're talking, because I'm pretty sure I got the Observer pattern backwards in my application.  I think I want DCEs to be on the subject side of things and receive buffers to be on the observation side of Observer operations.  The DCE tap will be identical to a physical ethernet card so once it's initialized with libnet and pcap (on the DCE side we'll be more interested in the packet capture, rx, DCE, pcap stuff) we will be able to just operate pcap as though it was the ConcreteSubject (the DCE holding state) and the rx buffer being the ConcreteObserver, the one handling the data.

# Answers to questions #

The DCEs will each have an rx buffer and they'll work fifo.  And they'll have only payload in them, as we discussed and there absolutely no concern given to buffer overflow.  When rx <dce> is run it take out the oldest log and the the fifo is shortened appropriately.  If the rx <dce> is run on an empty queue there are no ramifications and a NULL is returned for payload.  For now at least the Observers will check for new data without an event driven mechanism.

I'm glad we're having this talk.  I'm eager to hear your comments and questions, partner!

/////////////

Questions Before We Code
Do you want fixed-size RX Buffers, or should they dynamically grow as needed?
How do you want to handle RX Buffers persisting across runs (if at all)? Should they be cleared on restart?
Should the RX buffer be thread-safe in case you later want to access it from multiple threads?

////////////////

# Answers to questions #
I want fixed size bufers.  They'll probably only have to hold a couple messages before they're consumed.  This whole sytem is all human controlled in this first carnation where it's just these first 4 components, all based on this cmd we got going here.  As far a what's typical for a system such as this by way of a fixed buffer I'll defer to your inclination for the size.  There might be a circumstance where there's some computer generated DTE/DCE traffic so try to find a good comprimise at the very low side of a fixed size buffer for a slow type of computer comms system.  But yeah, just fixed size.

I think the rx buffers should be cleard on startup.  No persistent state.  However, I wouldn't explicitly clear the buffer so if in between sessions you so happen to get the same pointer to the buffer, the old messages might still be there, but you'd never know unless you had a way to look and actually wanted to.

I like the idea of each DCE running in a thread for sure but over and above whatever thread safety is needed as a minmum for that I wouldn't add.

///////////////

Next Steps Before Code
Do you like a buffer size of 8, or do you want it smaller/larger?
Do you prefer dropping the oldest message when full, or should we reject new messages if full?
Would you like a command to check buffer size & current occupancy (e.g., rx_status <dce>)?

////////////////

# Answers to questions #
- that buffer size of 8 is fine.
- yes I'd like to drop the oldest message.
- if you'd like to rig up a command for buffer status that would be great.  I'll show you the Command class code below:

class Command {
public:
    using CommandFunction = std::function<void()>;

    Command(std::string name, CommandFunction func);

    void execute() const;

    const std::string getName() const;

private:
    std::string name;
    CommandFunction func;
};

Commands are constructed with a name and a function pointer so if you'd make your command like a Command class object that would be grateful and it would be appreciated for when it's time to be integrated in with the existing Command pattern in the cmd code base.

It was nice how you got all the code in one file last time - that was good thinking.  And with a main() was nice and we can separate out the declarations and implementations later when it time to migrate the DCE and Observer code you're working on and have already wrote some of over to the existing cmd code base, right?  So for now let's get this receive side of things with the DCEs and the Observers and rx buffers running in your single file with the main() wiring it all together and perturbing it with, right?  Correct me if I'm wrong, otherwise send the code down, partner!

//////////////

Please take a look at this EthernetFrame code, which you'll maybe use yourself one day, and see if you can find what's wrong and fix it.  VSCode complains about the constructor.  It's missing two method() implementations as well.  The thing is that it compiles from the command line with this:

g++ -o demo demo.cpp -Iusr/include/jsoncpp/json -lnet -lpcap -ljsoncpp

It gives very nice output:

root@PRED:/usr/local/cmd# ./demo
Buffer1 Size: 1
Buffer2 Size: 1
Consumed: Packet from DCE1
Buffer1 Size: 2
Buffer2 Size: 3
Consumed: Packet from DCE1

Buffer2 Size: 5
Consumed: Packet from DCE1
Buffer1 Size: 4

Consumed: Packet from DCE1
Buffer1 Size: 5
Buffer2 Size: 8
Consumed: Packet from DCE1
exit
root@PRED:/usr/local/cmd# exit
logout
user1@PRED:~$ 

I'm grateful for that code, thanks!  Until I get that EthernetFrame class behaving I won't be able to run the VSCode debugger, which is a shame because I find it fun.

About DCE initialization.  I don't see any mention of libnet or pcap implementation in the code you've generated and I wonder if it's strategically being left until later, or if it's an oversight and also I'd like to inform you that I added a system call to the DCE destructor in the version before this last one:

    ~DCE() {
        stop();
        system("ip link delete tap0");
    }

Is that a good enough way for us to release the taps?

How would you recommend moving forward now?  When the code that you're working on now is intializing the DCE taps so that they're ready to go with libnet and pcap and the observers and rx buffers are all in place I'll integrate this code into the cmd codebase and you and I can then work on a DTE driver.  And don't forget that all DTEs and DCEs need to be operated with both pcap and libnet because just because a DTE primarily transmits with libnet it might use the rx channel and pcap for handshaking and the same goes for DCEs.

Here's the EthernetFrame code:

// EthernetFrame.hpp

    EthernetFrame(const std::array<uint8_t, 6>& srcMac, const std::array<uint8_t, 6>& dstMac, const std::vector<uint8_t>& payload);

    srcMac = mac;
}

    dstMac = mac;
}

void EthernetFrame::setPayload(const std::vector<uint8_t>& data) {
    payload = data;
}

const std::array<uint8_t, 6>& EthernetFrame::getSrcMac() const {
    return srcMac;
}

const std::array<uint8_t, 6>& EthernetFrame::getDstMac() const {
    return dstMac;
}

std::vector<uint8_t>& EthernetFrame::getPayload() {
    return payload;
}

std::vector<uint8_t> EthernetFrame::serialize() const {
    std::vector<uint8_t> data;
    data.insert(data.end(), srcMac.begin(), srcMac.end());
    data.insert(data.end(), dstMac.begin(), dstMac.end());
    data.insert(data.end(), payload.begin(), payload.end());
    return data;
}

EthernetFrame EthernetFrame::deserialize(const std::vector<uint8_t>& data) {
    if (data.size() < 12) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Invalid Ethernet frame size");
    }
    
    EthernetFrame frame;
    std::copy(data.begin(), data.begin() + 6, frame.srcMac.begin());
    std::copy(data.begin() + 6, data.begin() + 12, frame.dstMac.begin());
    frame.getPayload().assign(data.begin() + 12, data.end());
    
    return frame;
}

I might have the json.h and the compiler -I, -l or -L wrong... maybe I need a -L.  At the path /usr/include/jsoncpp/json there's a json.h though.

# Your First Three Next Steps
1. Test EthernetFrame in VSCode Debugger.
2. Integrate TAP initialization into DCE.
3. Ensure both DTE & DCE use pcap & libnet for RX/TX.

But that VSCode dubugger stuff isn't the primary focus for us.  I got your EthernetFrame code in the project and I"m happy to say it looks very good and it's in the project folder with no errors and the cmd CMake load build runs just fine.  So, with that in mind feel free to completely ignore the VSCode compile and debugger issue in favor of the cmd code.  So this go-around in messages focus on 2. and 3. above, but 1. would be nice to have too.

/////////////////////

Ok that looks really great with all the libnet and pcap usage.  Now I'd like you to look at the code below, which is the previous version of the code you've been sending me (which I call demo.cpp) where the Observer is in place.  Now right at the end of your last message you put down as a next step "2. Create a simple observer model for notifying packet reception" but it seems to me the below code, you previous code, has the Observer pattern implemented for this purpose already.  I'd like for you to make a final demo.cpp with all of the functionality of the Observer pattern, with all of the libnet and pcap stuff of this current iteration and also the tap creation and initialization.

///////////////////

Alright, thanks for the VSCode help.  I'm lookin at demo.cpp with the debugger now, and it's likely to help us quite a bit.

Right off the bat the program crashes in the DCE constructor because it tries to initialize a tap before creating the tap.  The taps need to be created and it's these virtualized ethernet NICs is what I expect your code to initialize and use with pcap and libnet as though they were real, physical NICs.  The code you're adding to and continuing to enhance in demo.cpp with functionality will have to create the taps (two in our sample demo), set them up and operate them for their lifetimes with libnet and pcap, and gracefully release and destroy everything that needs to be.  While up and operating the code you're adding to and enhancing in demo.cpp has to use the Observer pattern that you've implemented in the code already to service the rx buffers.

This iteration it crashed on:

        pcapHandle = pcap_open_live(tapName.c_str(), BUFSIZ, 1, 1000, errbuf);

likely because there was no tap created for it to be applied to as dev.  What you should use for dev is the name you gave the tap when you created it.

/////////////////

It works really well.  But it gets lost in the pcap_loop though. So the program never terminates, it goes into start capture and stays there.  The taps are getting created and capture real traffic as confirmed by wireshark.  Do those pcap_loops need to be put in their own threads or something?


//////////////////


Oh it's a thing of beauty now.  It's very exciting.  I've got a Command pattern in the cmd code base that I'm aching to point at the DTE part of cmd the way you and I just pointed the DCE part of the code at the rx buffers.

I've got a question.  Is this part of the code in Observer:

class RxObserver : public IObserver {
public:
    void update(const std::vector<uint8_t>& packet) override {
        // Process received packet
        std::cout << "RxObserver received packet of size: " << packet.size() << " bytes" << std::endl;
    }
};

where in practice the rx buffer could be written with packet, or a part of packet, like packet.size() instead of just being printed out with std::cout, like in the code and the example above?  Would it be the proper use of to write the packets to their respective rx buffers, instead of just printing out a message?

And I was wondering if in that code there are two taps and they each have an observer and they could both be connected to individual rx buffers.

/////////////////////

# Chat GPT Partner Feedback and Way Forward #

Good morning, partner.  Here's somefeedback for you.  You have done a very very good job for me and I'm grateful.  Your code, with the odd tweak here and there by me, has resulted in a really nice DCE RX channel for cmd.  I managed to scrounge up some kbhit() code, because the conio.h one was being difficult.  I currently have this in main() of our demo.cpp:

bool kbhit()
{
    termios term;
    tcgetattr(0, &term);

    termios term2 = term;
    term2.c_lflag &= ~ICANON;
    tcsetattr(0, TCSANOW, &term2);

    int byteswaiting;
    ioctl(0, FIONREAD, &byteswaiting);

    tcsetattr(0, TCSANOW, &term);

    return byteswaiting > 0;
}

int main() {
    try {
        std::string tap1 = createTapDevice("tap0");
        std::string tap2 = createTapDevice("tap1");

        // Initialize libnet
        char errbuf[LIBNET_ERRBUF_SIZE];
        libnet_t *lnet1 = libnet_init(LIBNET_RAW4, tap1.c_str(), errbuf);
        libnet_t *lnet2 = libnet_init(LIBNET_RAW4, tap2.c_str(), errbuf);
        if (!lnet1 || !lnet2) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Failed to initialize libnet: " + std::string(errbuf));
        }

        // Create DCE instances for each TAP device
        auto dce1 = std::make_shared<DCE>(tap1);
        auto dce2 = std::make_shared<DCE>(tap2);

        // Create Observers for each DCE instance
        auto observer1 = std::make_shared<RxObserver>();
        auto observer2 = std::make_shared<RxObserver>();

        // Attach Observers
        dce1->attach(observer1);
        dce2->attach(observer2);

        std::vector<uint8_t> packet1 = observer1->getNextPacket();

        std::cout << "DCE is running. Press Enter to exit..." << std::endl;

        // Start packet capture
        dce1->startCapture();
        dce2->startCapture();

        bool running = true;
        int i = 100;
        while(!kbhit())
        {
            sleep(.1);
            std::vector<uint8_t> packet1 = observer1->getNextPacket();

            if (!packet1.empty()) {
                std::cout << "Processing packet from TAP 1, size: " << packet1.size() << " bytes" << std::endl;
            }

            std::vector<uint8_t> packet2 = observer2->getNextPacket();
            if (!packet2.empty()) {
                std::cout << "Processing packet from TAP 2, size: " << packet2.size() << " bytes" << std::endl;
            }

        }

        // Stop packet capture
        dce1->stopCapture();
        dce2->stopCapture();

        // Cleanup libnet
        libnet_destroy(lnet1);
        libnet_destroy(lnet2);

    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

The kbhit() and while(!kbhit()) stuff is just temporary.  For now if gives demo.cpp a nice way to quit out while monitoring for observer action... I'll say it works well.  Here's some random screen output to give you an idea of its performance:

root@PRED:/usr/local/cmd# ./demo

I have a question now.  DCEs aren't just silent rx devices, they have an upstream capability, even though formally its focus should be to facilitate the DTEs transfer.  For my application of taps as DCEs I'm not presently using the up stream capability of the tap DCEs.  We should have a command tx <dce-src-mac> <dte-dst-mac> <payload> to be a proper DCE.  But this brings up the question of demo.cpp/cmd project integration because when we talk about adding commands we're talking about using the Command pattern code that's already present in cmd (I've sent you that code, you might still have it and are able to look at it, otherwise if you ask I'll happily send it to you).

I want to run this idea past you that what we take on next is creating a command in demo.cpp kind of along the lines of the main() in cmd:

void testCommandFunction() {
    std::cout << "Test command executed successfully!" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    Cmd myCmd;
    myCmd.addCommand("Test command", testCommandFunction);

    std::cout << "Executing stored command..." << std::endl;
    myCmd.executeCommand("Test command");

    return 0;
}

See above where a command is created and then executed just as a test in my production/dev environment.  Could you take the existing cmd code of Cmd, Command and EthernetFrame, along with your demo.cpp code and put them together with a new main() to create an integrated single program with both the command handling capability of cmd and also the rx dce capabilities of demo.cpp?  Maybe it would look something like this:

// demo.cpp

#include <Cmd.hpp>
#include <Command.hpp>

int main()
{

    // This pseudo-code makes the commands
    Cmd myCmd;
    myCmd.addCommand("tx_dce", tx_dceFunction);
    myCmd.addCommand("rx_dce", rx_dceFunction);

    // This pseudo-code makes the taps and initializes the taps and operates 
    // the taps with libnet and pcap
try {
        std::string tap1 = createTapDevice("tap0");
        std::string tap2 = createTapDevice("tap1");

        // Initialize libnet
        char errbuf[LIBNET_ERRBUF_SIZE];
        libnet_t *lnet1 = libnet_init(LIBNET_RAW4, tap1.c_str(), errbuf);
        libnet_t *lnet2 = libnet_init(LIBNET_RAW4, tap2.c_str(), errbuf);
        if (!lnet1 || !lnet2) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Failed to initialize libnet: " + std::string(errbuf));
        }

        // Create DCE instances for each TAP device
        auto dce1 = std::make_shared<DCE>(tap1);
        auto dce2 = std::make_shared<DCE>(tap2);

        // Create Observers for each DCE instance
        auto observer1 = std::make_shared<RxObserver>();
        auto observer2 = std::make_shared<RxObserver>();

        // Attach Observers
        dce1->attach(observer1);
        dce2->attach(observer2);

        std::vector<uint8_t> packet1 = observer1->getNextPacket();

        // Start packet capture
        dce1->startCapture();
        dce2->startCapture();

        // This pseudo-code transmits on the DCEs and also explicitly receives on a DCE.
        // Remember if the rx buffer is empty there are no consequences, just an empty payload.
        myCmd.executeCommand("tx_dce_tap1");
        myCmd.executeCommand("tx_dce_tap2");
        myCmd.executeCommand("rx_dce_tap1");
        myCmd.executeCommand("rx_dce_tap2");

        // Stop packet capture
        dce1->stopCapture();
        dce2->stopCapture();

        // Cleanup libnet
        libnet_destroy(lnet1);
        libnet_destroy(lnet2);

    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

Don't code anything yet... let's get our plan of action highly detailed and get your questions answered first and anwwering your question always makes my understanding of what I'm trying to accomplish clearer too.

So let's start off with you commenting and criticizing what's above, with respect to the integration of demo.cpp and cmd and the cmd classes of Cmd, Command and EthernetFrame.

//////////////////////

There are just a couple things to fix that I've spotted right away and VSCode flags as erroneous:

            EthernetFrame frame(data);
            dce1->transmitFrame(frame);

The constructor for a frame is like this:

EthernetFrame::EthernetFrame(const std::array<uint8_t, 6>& srcMac, 
                             const std::array<uint8_t, 6>& dstMac, 
                             const std::vector<uint8_t>& payload) 
    : srcMac(srcMac), dstMac(dstMac), payload(payload) {}

so the EthernetFrame frame(data) line doesn't work.

And not only is EthernetFrame frame wrong but there is no DCE::transmitFrame() method.  Can you please properly create the EthernetFrame and add a DCE::transmitFrame() method?


////////////////////

Please advise on how to use the command dce_transmit on the demo.cpp command line.

Also, could you send me the updated DCE.h with the transmitFrame() method in it please?

Something is still wrong and I might have an idea what.  See this:

void Command::execute() const {
        func();
}

and notice that func() doesn't have any arguments.  Will we need and overloaded func() method?  For testing purposed and simplicity I'd like something quick for now that'll make the new dce_transmit command work.  For now I don't want you to provide a comprehensive solution that'll work in the generic case, just something quick and easy to prove the concept of dce transmission.

Here's the compiler output:

I hope you can help me getting the dce_transmit function to get through the sorting process and actually execute the command.  You see the system will perform addCommand("name", func_ptr) but at the time it runs with the arguments it compares the whole line to the "name" like this:

"dce_transmit 11:22:33:44:55:66 aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff \"Hello world!!\""

So I get command not found, of course.

///////////////

Take a closer look at how the user inputs the dce_transmit command and whether quotes are used for arguments or not and how spaces are considered.  With regards to the spaces "Hello World!!" internally to the program splits up the input string, even the payload it seems, at ' ' characters, the space. 

Created TAP device: tap0
Created TAP device: tap1
DCE is running.
Enter command: 
dce_transmit 11:22:33:44:55:66 aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff "Hello World!!"

payload[0] = '"'
payload[1] = 'H'
payload[2] = 'e'
payload[3] = 'l'
payload[4] = 'l'
payload[5] = 'o'

srcMac:
    _M_elems[0] = 17
    _M_elems[1] = 34
    _M_elems[2] = 51
    _M_elems[3] = 68
    _M_elems[4] = 85
    _M_elems[5] = 102

- Hey partner I just realized that those elems are multiples of 17, probably unimportant though.

dstMac:
    _M_elems[0] = 170
    _M_elems[1] = 187
    _M_elems[2] = 204
    _M_elems[3] = 221
    _M_elems[4] = 238
    _M_elems[5] = 255

- strange relationship to 17 here too, but probably unimportant unless it's significant to you.

In this DCE code:

    void transmitFrame(const EthernetFrame& frame) {
        libnet_ptag_t ethernetTag = libnet_build_ethernet(
            frame.getDstMac().data(), frame.getSrcMac().data(),
            ETHERTYPE_IP, frame.getPayload().data(), frame.getPayload().size(),
            lnet, 0
        );

        if (ethernetTag == -1) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Failed to build Ethernet frame: " + std::string(libnet_geterror(lnet)));
        }

the ethernetTag is always returned as -1 and this is where I need your help.  Could this usage of libnet ge getting the wrong data?  Could this usage of libnet be conflicting with its initialization - like the diffence between the layer 2 initialization vs layer 3?

////////////////////////
I've changed the initialization to LIBNET_LINK.  Thanks for the advice.

I'm working with the new parseCommand() function you've sent and it has some behaior we'll have to iron out.

First of all the input is:

R"(dce_transmit 11:22:33:44:55:66 aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff "Hello World!!")"

in the main() of that parseCommand() file that I call input.cpp.  But on the terminal prompt how am I expected to use quotes and '(' and ')' to work with demo.cpp and the dce_transmit command when I'm running it in person?

When I step through the parseCommand() code what is does is take what it calls a token and assigns it dce_transmit which in turn is assigned to args then it fails on the while loop condition and falls out of parseCommand() with args bein just args[0] = "dce_transmit".

std::vector<std::string> parseCommand(const std::string& input) {
    std::vector<std::string> args;
    std::istringstream iss(input);
    std::string token;
    bool inQuotes = false;
    std::string quotedString;

    while (iss >> std::noskipws >> token) {
        if (token.front() == '"' && !inQuotes) {
            inQuotes = true;
            quotedString = token.substr(1); // Remove leading quote
        } else if (token.back() == '"' && inQuotes) {
            inQuotes = false;
            quotedString += " " + token.substr(0, token.length() - 1); // Remove trailing quote
            args.push_back(quotedString);
        } else if (inQuotes) {
            quotedString += " " + token;
        } else {
            args.push_back(token);
        }
    }
    
    return args;
}

this is the branch it executes to put "dce_transmit" in args[0].
-             args.push_back(token);

Then it fails this condition:
-     while (iss >> std::noskipws >> token) {

and args returns with just the command name:

args = args[0] = "dce_transmit"


///////////////////////
This is interesting.  It's still not working.  Output of ./input is:

args[0] = dce_transmit

It picks up the dce_transmit part properly.

The while loop condition fails next iteration and it's this:

    while (iss >> std::noskipws >> token) {

but in the debugger variable window it says this about iss:

iss = Cannot instantiate printer for default visualizer

I don't know how the while loop would evaluate the condition statement with iss displayed in the debugger so strangely.  Could maybe the parameter "input" be handled improperly somewhere in the area of treating input as a value or a pointer?

////////////////////

This is going really well.  Thanks for your help.  I'd like you to help me use parseCommand() in demo.  Where my command selection and ultimate calling of the function was being done is in Cmd.cpp:

void Cmd::executeCommand(const std::string& name) const {
    std::istringstream iss(name);
    std::string commandName;
    iss >> commandName;  // Extract the first word

    auto it = commands.find(commandName);
    if (it != commands.end()) {
        std::vector<std::string> args;
        std::string arg;
        while (iss >> arg) {
            args.push_back(arg);
        }
        it->second.execute(args);
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Command not found: " << commandName << std::endl;
    }
}

This line:

        it->second.execute(args);

takes the args which is what parseCommand() returns, but I don't have a really good way of getting the parseCommand() output into the it->secong.execute(args); statement.  Should I make parseCommand a member method?  Or should is it more appropriate for it to be a helper function?

Please advise on this?
