Thanks for the code.  It works great and it's very exciting.  I'm fairly new to design patterns but I"m a big fan.  If one were to compare the description of the Observer pattern in the famous GoF book "Design Patterns" would the Subject be an abstract receive buffer and a DCE be an abstract Observer?

In the DCE class is the run() method where the rest of the system can access the DCE class?  Right now the run() method just prints out a hearbeat every second but is the intention for actual real-world implementation that this run() method be the sort of take-off point for another part of a program to run its logic in it?  Like if this DCE class had libnet and pcap initialization of the tap in the initializeTAP() method along with the fap creation then maybe that run() routine could act like one of the players in the Observer pattern, like maybe a ConcreteObserver?  But don't let me convice or influence you... I don't know, I'm asking

Now what I'd like us to do is get an Observer pattern working so that we have 3 rx buffers that will store what's captured by pcap at a tap and that's all.  Just put the payload in the buffer, no ethernet protocol at all, no time stamp, no nothing, but the payload, preferable in a nice humanly readable form.

That'll be the rx channel for the cmd, that I alone or the both of us together will integrate into the cmd code base.

Don't generate code just yet, partner.  For now I'd like us to talk and answer questions until we're in agreement and up to speed.

///////

Questions Before We Code
How do you want to map TAPs to RX buffers? Should each TAP have exactly one RX buffer, or do multiple DCEs share the same buffer?
Do you want the RX buffers to hold multiple packets, or just the latest payload? (FIFO vs. last-packet-wins)
Should we introduce an event-driven mechanism for notifying Observers? (Or just have the Observers manually check for new data?)

/////////

Ok, I'm glad we're talking, because I'm pretty sure I got the Observer pattern backwards in my application.  I think I want DCEs to be on the subject side of things and receive buffers to be on the observation side of Observer operations.  The DCE tap will be identical to a physical ethernet card so once it's initialized with libnet and pcap (on the DCE side we'll be more interested in the packet capture, rx, DCE, pcap stuff) we will be able to just operate pcap as though it was the ConcreteSubject (the DCE holding state) and the rx buffer being the ConcreteObserver, the one handling the data.

# Answers to questions #

The DCEs will each have an rx buffer and they'll work fifo.  And they'll have only payload in them, as we discussed and there absolutely no concern given to buffer overflow.  When rx <dce> is run it take out the oldest log and the the fifo is shortened appropriately.  If the rx <dce> is run on an empty queue there are no ramifications and a NULL is returned for payload.  For now at least the Observers will check for new data without an event driven mechanism.

I'm glad we're having this talk.  I'm eager to hear your comments and questions, partner!

/////////////

Questions Before We Code
Do you want fixed-size RX Buffers, or should they dynamically grow as needed?
How do you want to handle RX Buffers persisting across runs (if at all)? Should they be cleared on restart?
Should the RX buffer be thread-safe in case you later want to access it from multiple threads?

////////////////

# Answers to questions #
I want fixed size bufers.  They'll probably only have to hold a couple messages before they're consumed.  This whole sytem is all human controlled in this first carnation where it's just these first 4 components, all based on this cmd we got going here.  As far a what's typical for a system such as this by way of a fixed buffer I'll defer to your inclination for the size.  There might be a circumstance where there's some computer generated DTE/DCE traffic so try to find a good comprimise at the very low side of a fixed size buffer for a slow type of computer comms system.  But yeah, just fixed size.

I think the rx buffers should be cleard on startup.  No persistent state.  However, I wouldn't explicitly clear the buffer so if in between sessions you so happen to get the same pointer to the buffer, the old messages might still be there, but you'd never know unless you had a way to look and actually wanted to.

I like the idea of each DCE running in a thread for sure but over and above whatever thread safety is needed as a minmum for that I wouldn't add.

///////////////

Next Steps Before Code
Do you like a buffer size of 8, or do you want it smaller/larger?
Do you prefer dropping the oldest message when full, or should we reject new messages if full?
Would you like a command to check buffer size & current occupancy (e.g., rx_status <dce>)?

////////////////

# Answers to questions #
- that buffer size of 8 is fine.
- yes I'd like to drop the oldest message.
- if you'd like to rig up a command for buffer status that would be great.  I'll show you the Command class code below:

class Command {
public:
    using CommandFunction = std::function<void()>;

    Command(std::string name, CommandFunction func);

    void execute() const;

    const std::string getName() const;

private:
    std::string name;
    CommandFunction func;
};

Commands are constructed with a name and a function pointer so if you'd make your command like a Command class object that would be grateful and it would be appreciated for when it's time to be integrated in with the existing Command pattern in the cmd code base.

It was nice how you got all the code in one file last time - that was good thinking.  And with a main() was nice and we can separate out the declarations and implementations later when it time to migrate the DCE and Observer code you're working on and have already wrote some of over to the existing cmd code base, right?  So for now let's get this receive side of things with the DCEs and the Observers and rx buffers running in your single file with the main() wiring it all together and perturbing it with, right?  Correct me if I'm wrong, otherwise send the code down, partner!

//////////////

Please take a look at this EthernetFrame code, which you'll maybe use yourself one day, and see if you can find what's wrong and fix it.  VSCode complains about the constructor.  It's missing two method() implementations as well.  The thing is that it compiles from the command line with this:

g++ -o demo demo.cpp -Iusr/include/jsoncpp/json -lnet -lpcap -ljsoncpp

It gives very nice output:

root@PRED:/usr/local/cmd# ./demo
Buffer1 Size: 1
Buffer2 Size: 1
Consumed: Packet from DCE1
Buffer1 Size: 2
Buffer2 Size: 3
Consumed: Packet from DCE1
Buffer1 Size: 3
Buffer2 Size: 5
Consumed: Packet from DCE1
Buffer1 Size: 4
Buffer2 Size: 7
Consumed: Packet from DCE1
Buffer1 Size: 5
Buffer2 Size: 8
Consumed: Packet from DCE1
exit
root@PRED:/usr/local/cmd# exit
logout
user1@PRED:~$ 

I'm grateful for that code, thanks!  Until I get that EthernetFrame class behaving I won't be able to run the VSCode debugger, which is a shame because I find it fun.

About DCE initialization.  I don't see any mention of libnet or pcap implementation in the code you've generated and I wonder if it's strategically being left until later, or if it's an oversight and also I'd like to inform you that I added a system call to the DCE destructor in the version before this last one:

    ~DCE() {
        stop();
        system("ip link delete tap0");
    }

Is that a good enough way for us to release the taps?

How would you recommend moving forward now?  When the code that you're working on now is intializing the DCE taps so that they're ready to go with libnet and pcap and the observers and rx buffers are all in place I'll integrate this code into the cmd codebase and you and I can then work on a DTE driver.  And don't forget that all DTEs and DCEs need to be operated with both pcap and libnet because just because a DTE primarily transmits with libnet it might use the rx channel and pcap for handshaking and the same goes for DCEs.

Here's the EthernetFrame code:

// EthernetFrame.hpp
class EthernetFrame {
public:
    EthernetFrame(const std::array<uint8_t, 6>& srcMac, const std::array<uint8_t, 6>& dstMac, const std::vector<uint8_t>& payload);

    std::array<uint8_t, 6> dstMac;
    std::vector<uint8_t> payload;
};

// EthernetFrame.cpp
EthernetFrame::EthernetFrame() : srcMac{}, dstMac{}, payload{} {}

void EthernetFrame::setSrcMac(const std::array<uint8_t, 6>& mac) {
    srcMac = mac;
}

void EthernetFrame::setDstMac(const std::array<uint8_t, 6>& mac) {
    dstMac = mac;
}

void EthernetFrame::setPayload(const std::vector<uint8_t>& data) {
    payload = data;
}

const std::array<uint8_t, 6>& EthernetFrame::getSrcMac() const {
    return srcMac;
}

const std::array<uint8_t, 6>& EthernetFrame::getDstMac() const {
    return dstMac;
}

std::vector<uint8_t>& EthernetFrame::getPayload() {
    return payload;
}

std::vector<uint8_t> EthernetFrame::serialize() const {
    std::vector<uint8_t> data;
    data.insert(data.end(), srcMac.begin(), srcMac.end());
    data.insert(data.end(), dstMac.begin(), dstMac.end());
    data.insert(data.end(), payload.begin(), payload.end());
    return data;
}

EthernetFrame EthernetFrame::deserialize(const std::vector<uint8_t>& data) {
    if (data.size() < 12) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Invalid Ethernet frame size");
    }
    
    EthernetFrame frame;
    std::copy(data.begin(), data.begin() + 6, frame.srcMac.begin());
    std::copy(data.begin() + 6, data.begin() + 12, frame.dstMac.begin());
    frame.getPayload().assign(data.begin() + 12, data.end());
    
    return frame;
}

I might have the json.h and the compiler -I, -l or -L wrong... maybe I need a -L.  At the path /usr/include/jsoncpp/json there's a json.h though.

# Your First Three Next Steps
1. Test EthernetFrame in VSCode Debugger.
2. Integrate TAP initialization into DCE.
3. Ensure both DTE & DCE use pcap & libnet for RX/TX.

But that VSCode dubugger stuff isn't the primary focus for us.  I got your EthernetFrame code in the project and I"m happy to say it looks very good and it's in the project folder with no errors and the cmd CMake load build runs just fine.  So, with that in mind feel free to completely ignore the VSCode compile and debugger issue in favor of the cmd code.  So this go-around in messages focus on 2. and 3. above, but 1. would be nice to have too.

/////////////////////

Ok that looks really great with all the libnet and pcap usage.  Now I'd like you to look at the code below, which is the previous version of the code you've been sending me (which I call demo.cpp) where the Observer is in place.  Now right at the end of your last message you put down as a next step "2. Create a simple observer model for notifying packet reception" but it seems to me the below code, you previous code, has the Observer pattern implemented for this purpose already.  I'd like for you to make a final demo.cpp with all of the functionality of the Observer pattern, with all of the libnet and pcap stuff of this current iteration and also the tap creation and initialization.

///////////////////

Alright, thanks for the VSCode help.  I'm lookin at demo.cpp with the debugger now, and it's likely to help us quite a bit.

Right off the bat the program crashes in the DCE constructor because it tries to initialize a tap before creating the tap.  The taps need to be created and it's these virtualized ethernet NICs is what I expect your code to initialize and use with pcap and libnet as though they were real, physical NICs.  The code you're adding to and continuing to enhance in demo.cpp with functionality will have to create the taps (two in our sample demo), set them up and operate them for their lifetimes with libnet and pcap, and gracefully release and destroy everything that needs to be.  While up and operating the code you're adding to and enhancing in demo.cpp has to use the Observer pattern that you've implemented in the code already to service the rx buffers.

This iteration it crashed on:

        pcapHandle = pcap_open_live(tapName.c_str(), BUFSIZ, 1, 1000, errbuf);

likely because there was no tap created for it to be applied to as dev.  What you should use for dev is the name you gave the tap when you created it.

/////////////////

It works really well.  But it gets lost in the pcap_loop though. So the program never terminates, it goes into start capture and stays there.  The taps are getting created and capture real traffic as confirmed by wireshark.  Do those pcap_loops need to be put in their own threads or something?
